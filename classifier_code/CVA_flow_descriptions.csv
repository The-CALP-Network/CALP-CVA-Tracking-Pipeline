Country Strategic Plan for food assistance to the poor and severely food insecure population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip WFP is committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is guided by a strategic, programmatic and governance instrument to operationalize its plan and achieve its project objectives to: 
• End Hunger by protecting access to food and by improving dietary diversity;
• Support the implementation of the SDGs by enhancing the capacities of national institutions to implement food security strategies and operations;
This project directly contributes to strategic objectives two and three of the Humanitarian Response Plan 2018 2020, by meeting the basic food needs of severely vulnerable Palestinians and by improving their dietary diversity. 
WFP’s interventions focus on high food insecurity levels, including the malnutrition levels recorded by national surveys. By assisting the poor and severely food insecure Palestinian households in Gaza and Bedouin and herding communities in West Bank’s Area C, and by disseminating information on food and nutrition practices, WFP addresses the basic needs of vulnerable Palestinians and tackles one of the or root causes of some of the food insecurity levels recorded by the government institutions.
These interventions aim at improving the overall food security levels including nutrition and health status of the vulnerable Palestinians and therefore at increasing their coping abilities to sudden shocks in the market for access to food. 
The project also contributes to the Food Security Sector’s three objectives as well as to the National Policy Agenda 2017-2022 (policies on escaping poverty and strengthening social protection as well as meeting the basic needs of the communities) to ensure that the vulnerable Palestinians households basic food needs are met, by assisting households in enhancing their food security levels and by strengthening national institutions in implementing food security strategies and social security safety net programs to best identify and target food insecure and vulnerable Palestinians.",1

--- SOCIAL PROTECTION  Expanding Social, Civic and Economic Engagement and Social Cohesion Interventions for Conﬂict-Affected Adolescents and Youth in the Syrian Arab Republic In support of the ERL Sector (Strengthened Communities and Participation), UNICEF, through this project in 2023, will further support its Generation Unlimited initiative and No Lost Generation Agenda by empowering vulnerable adolescents and youth (10-24 years), female and male and those with disabilities, to access social, civic and economic opportunities for skill development and engagement (including participation in social cohesion initiatives) with the objective of contributing to enhancing resilience and social cohesion. UNICEF will build on strategic partnerships, integration and at scale programming focusing on the most vulnerable adolescents to strengthen skills development, employability and meaningful engagement through friendly spaces and mobile teams. The proposed project will support young women and men to have better access to civic, social, and economic opportunities for skill development and engagement and to unleash their potentials and increase their learning, leadership, and employability opportunities. 
UNICEF will promote the active and meaningful participation of young people brought together from different ages, genders, abilities and cultural and educational backgrounds to be agents of positive change in their communities. UNICEF will work in the following three pillars and related interventions: (1) Provide access to services and skills-building for adolescents and youth for enhanced employability. (2) Strengthen social, civic and economic engagement of adolescents and youth and foster volunteerism and social cohesion-building. (3) Support young entrepreneurs to start their own project projects through seed funding. UNICEF will continue strengthening the capacity of local partners including services providers, youth workers and young volunteers to improve the quality of provided services and enhance the evidence generation. UNICEF will support the scalable and sustainable approaches with national partners including integrated centers & platforms.
In this project, UNICEF will give priority to adolescents and youth in the high severity areas such as Dara’a, Rural Damascus, Northern Homs, Southern Hama, East and Northeast of Aleppo, Deir-ez-Zor and Idleb. UNICEF will expand its support to young people in NES, focusing on returnees and displaced people in Raqqa and Hasakah, including those in camps, collective shelters and urban settings. UNICEF will focus on the most deprived areas in rural and urban areas. These will include camps (Hol, Roj, Newroz, Areesha, Mahmoudli) in Al-Hasakeh and Raqqa , the collective shelters in Al-Hasakeh city, and the rural areas in Qamishli, Malikia, Yaroubia, and Raqqa Governorate. Projects engaging young people will be essential needs for their effective integration in their communities. In addition, since 2014, many young people have been staying in camps and collective shelters. They do not enjoy the freedom of movement and face other risks, thus offering them activities that will enhance their skills and allow them to catch up to their peers in terms of skills and non-formal education.  The programme will coordinate with and support other UNICEF programmes to ensure interventions are tailored to the particular needs of young people. The programme will implement activities for young people affected by, or at high risk of, emergencies or the socio-economic situation, to acquire the right skills, become empowered and resilient community members who help their communities to cope with emergencies. Life-skills and citizenship education for these adolescents will equip and empower them to act as both participants and catalysts of change in their community as volunteers and peer influencers.

--- SOCIAL PROTECTION Education Coordination for a predictable, holistic and well-coordinated response in Syria With an estimated 12 per cent of school age children not attending any form of learning, availability of and access to quality education services remains a challenge within Syria that requires an effectively coordinated needs-based response amongst humanitarian education actors. Additional data sources indicate that there are over 2 million school age children that are out of school.

The complexity of the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the systemic gap between education needs and the education response, demands larger investments in strengthening the existing coordination structures to support its membership to deliver a predictable, efficient, effective and inclusive response that can meet needs and enable evidence-based donor decision making. This includes moving beyond service delivery to strengthen the quality and holistic package of support that learners need, taking into account the various learning needs across all levels. 

UNICEF and Save the Children co-lead at the WOS and Gaziantep Cluster, while UNICEF leads the Education sector, with the Ministry of Education as the co-lead, in Damascus, and Save the Children leads the Education Working Group in NES.

UNICEF and Save the Children, as co-leads of the Education Sector, will continue to support all aspects of the humanitarian programme cycle, advocacy and resource mobilization efforts, promote synergies and information sharing among members at the  hub level and information between the hubs and focus on key strategic activities related to the six core coordination functions, namely:
•	Support service delivery based on needs;
•	Inform strategic decision-making through needs assessments and gaps analysis;
•	Plan and implement cluster strategies;
•	Monitor and evaluate performance;
•	Build national capacities;
•	Support advocacy efforts
Given that the majority of the response is carried out by local organizations, coordination efforts will be approached through a localization and inclusiveness lens.

These will include camps (Hol, Roj, Newroz, Areesha, Mahmoudli) in Al-Hasakeh and Raqqa , the collective shelters in Al-Hasakeh city, and the rural areas in Qamishli, Malikia, Yaroubia, and Raqqa Governorate. Projects engaging young people will be essential needs for their effective integration in their communities. In addition, since 2014, many young people have been staying in camps and collective shelters. They do not enjoy the freedom of movement and face other risks, thus offering them activities that will enhance their skills and allow them to catch up to their peers in terms of skills and non-formal education.  The programme will coordinate with and support other UNICEF programmes to ensure interventions are tailored to the particular needs of young people. The programme will implement activities for young people affected by, or at high risk of, emergencies or the socio-economic situation, to acquire the right skills, become empowered and resilient community members who help their communities to cope with emergencies. Life-skills and citizenship education for these adolescents will equip and empower them to act as both participants and catalysts of change in their community as volunteers and peer influencers.

--- SOCIAL PROTECTION  Expanding Social, Civic and Economic Engagement and Social Cohesion Interventions for Conﬂict-Affected Adolescents and Youth in the Syrian Arab Republic In support of the ERL Sector (Strengthened Communities and Participation), UNICEF, through this project in 2023, will further support its Generation Unlimited initiative and No Lost Generation Agenda by empowering vulnerable adolescents and youth (10-24 years), female and male and those with disabilities, to access social, civic and economic opportunities for skill development and engagement (including participation in social cohesion initiatives) with the objective of contributing to enhancing resilience and social cohesion. UNICEF will build on strategic partnerships, integration and at scale programming focusing on the most vulnerable adolescents to strengthen skills development, employability and meaningful engagement through friendly spaces and mobile teams. The proposed project will support young women and men to have better access to civic, social, and economic opportunities for skill development and engagement and to unleash their potentials and increase their learning, leadership, and employability opportunities. 
UNICEF will promote the active and meaningful participation of young people brought together from different ages, genders, abilities and cultural and educational backgrounds to be agents of positive change in their communities. UNICEF will work in the following three pillars and related interventions: (1) Provide access to services and skills-building for adolescents and youth for enhanced employability. (2) Strengthen social, civic and economic engagement of adolescents and youth and foster volunteerism and social cohesion-building. (3) Support young entrepreneurs to start their own project projects through seed funding. UNICEF will continue strengthening the capacity of local partners including services providers, youth workers and young volunteers to improve the quality of provided services and enhance the evidence generation. UNICEF will support the scalable and sustainable approaches with national partners including integrated centers & platforms.
In this project, UNICEF will give priority to adolescents and youth in the high severity areas such as Dara’a, Rural Damascus, Northern Homs, Southern Hama, East and Northeast of Aleppo, Deir-ez-Zor and Idleb.

306026,"SHO funds for Social Protection  Expanding Social, Civic and Economic Engagement and Social Cohesion Interventions for Conﬂict-Affected Adolescents and Youth in the Syrian Arab Republic Needs: Young people in Syria face a myriad of interrelated barriers that prevent their meaningful economic, social, and civic participation and engagement. They face stigma and discrimination regarding their capacities to lead positive change in their communities. Limited opportunities for economic, social, and civic engagement, particularly for the most marginalized adolescents and youth, contribute to their systematic exclusion and exacerbate feelings of isolation and disenfranchisement. However, experiences from other contexts of protracted crisis have shown that supporting young people’s social and civic engagement can have positive social outcomes and be conducive to increased community resilience and social cohesion.
Intervention: In support of the ERL Sector, UNICEF will further its support for the Generation Unlimited initiative and No Lost Generation Agenda by empowering vulnerable adolescents and youth, both female and male, as well as those with disabilities, to access social, civic, and economic opportunities for skill development and engagement (including participation in social cohesion initiatives) with the objective of contributing to enhancing resilience and social cohesion. UNICEF will build on strategic partnerships, integration, and at-scale programming focusing on the most vulnerable adolescents to strengthen skills development, employability, and meaningful engagement through friendly spaces and mobile teams. The proposed project will support 342,883 young women and men per year to have better access to civic, social, and economic opportunities for skill development and engagement, and to unleash their potentials and increase their learning, leadership, and employability opportunities. UNICEF will work in the following two pillars and related interventions: (1) Strengthen social, civic, and economic engagement of adolescents and youth and foster volunteerism and social cohesion-building. (2) Support young entrepreneurs to start their own projects through seed funding. UNICEF will continue strengthening the capacity of local partners, including services providers, youth workers, and young volunteers, to improve the quality of provided services and enhance evidence generation.
Protection Risk Analysis: After enduring 12 years of conflict and ongoing economic turmoil, young Syrians have faced devastating hardships that have eroded their resilience. This has particularly affected girls, who have resorted to harmful coping mechanisms such as dropping out of school, engaging in addictive behaviors, entering child labor, and marrying early. Social norms in many communities also hinder girls' and people with disabilities' participation in sports, cultural activities, and community engagement. The compounding effects of COVID-19, earthquakes, and economic challenges have exacerbated these risks. UNICEF will continue to mainstream the principles of safety, dignity, and do no harm, as well as the inclusive and meaningful access of the most marginalized boys and girls, especially those who live with disabilities, to ensure that no one is left behind. UNICEF will increase safe access to skills development, social cohesion, awareness-raising, and engagement opportunities. UNICEF will prioritize developing the capacity of the implementing partners through providing technical support in the fields of Child Safeguarding, Code of Conduct, and PSEA.
Risks: Economic deterioration and transportation barriers, along with potential conflicts between IDPs and host communities, as well as risks of exploitation or abuse. To address these risks, there will be capacity building for staff and volunteers, awareness campaigns on risks, mandatory screening during recruitment, establishing complaint mechanisms with adequate staff for follow-up, and ensuring data protection and confidentiality.

Assumptions: The project assumes support for integrated and joint approaches and the promotion of youth participation nationwide.",1
