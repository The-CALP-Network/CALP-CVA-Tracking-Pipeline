The project has been designed to address critical and key gaps in sustainable response in close coordination with the food security and Agricultural cluster objectives by contributing to the provision of capacity building and agricultural input distribution which will assist in the prevention of malnutrition and poverty for the most vulnerable communities. LWD will work in complementarity with ADRA’s Emergency Food Assistance (EFA V) in Dhamar. EFA V will ensure beneficiaries have access to food commodities that satisfy their needs and allow them to utilize their income to meet other needs including the development of stable income streams through unconditional cash assistance. LWD will work as a graduation program for families that have received food assistance in EFA V.
