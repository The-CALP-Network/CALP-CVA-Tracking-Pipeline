Based on the Food and Agriculture Sector 2018 sector strategy, approximately 6.5 million people are facing acute food insecurity with an additional 4 million at risk of falling into a situation of being food insecure. IDPs and people in besieged and Hard to Reach areas in addition to female headed households are between the most vulnerable groups that need food assistance to meet their minimum consumption needs. Women are increasingly becoming family breadwinners, heading more than third of the households.  Assistance to vulnerable groups with focus on female headed household will be prioritized. In addition, if the situation changed allowing a significant number of returnees among the IDPs and refugees, WFP will consider this group in the emergency general food assistance.

Restricted cash will focus on purchase of livelihood inputs and assets such as seeds and tools to enable beneficiaries invest on their lands thereby increasing amount of land planted, and addressing the challenge of seeds scarcity. 
Long term investment on productive assets will also be achieved through resilience programming. ACTED will adopt the APFS model to encourage transfer of knowledge and skills in modern farming techniques, encourage community engagement through participatory risk assessments, toward participatory planning and joint ownership of resources. Such an investment will be pegged on utilization of local capacities and knowledge, which will then be reinforced through interactive sessions toward realizing improved livelihoods, reduced gender inequality, inclusive economic and social growth, and overall transformation of communities.",None,TRUE,Full,Keyword + ML,Full,0.7720118,1,0,Manual,TRUE

Objective 2) Provide protection assistance, including community-based support, for highly vulnerable persons, to facilitate voluntary, safe, non-discriminatory and sustainable returns
Objective 3) Deliver immediate support to newly displaced persons by facilitating access to safety and providing protection assistance
Objective 4) Provide assistance to vulnerable individuals living in mixed populations areas with support to access government social protection systems, and assist with the provision of other specialised protection services.
 
DRC protection services seek to align with the following Strategic Objectives of the Humanitarian Response Plan:
Strategic Objective 1: Support highly vulnerable displaced families living in camps and sub-standard accommodation by providing services and assistance packages
Strategic Objective 2: Support highly vulnerable displaced families who are willing to return to their homes, but are unable to do so without assistance by providing package at their place of displacement when they return home. 
Strategic Objective 4: Support highly vulnerable people inadequately covered under the social protection floor by providing assistance packages and facilitating access to services.",None,TRUE,Full,Keyword + ML,Full,0.7131822,1,0,Manual,FALSE

This is accomplished through the provision of protection-focused shelter assistance that addresses the inadequacies in terms of the safety of vulnerable households.
This project will apply the standards set through technical guidelines on selected shelter activities drafted by the sector working group, UN partners and LRC to maximize impact, complement services and avoid duplication.

In response to the crisis, Caritas Lebanon (CL) will provide cash for shelter activities and minor renovation direct interventions to enable vulnerable households whose shelters were damaged to carry out essential repairs to ensure protection from the elements. The assistance will be provided as direct renovation interventions through a preset renovation methodology and quality assurance guidelines.

The intervention will ensure that rehabilitation of shelters will not lead to evictions or rent increases (do no harm) for the tenants. Finally, this intervention will be accompanied by services provided by other projects that fall under other sectors such as psychological first aid and psychosocial support.

Caritas Lebanon (CL) will organize trainings and ongoing technical capacity building through direct mentoring all along the project’s implementation. 

The emergency response will assist 2180 AFFECTED HOUSEHOLDS (approx. 10,900 INDIVIDUALS) in the economically vulnerable neighborhoods of Beirut and Metn. Eligible households will be selected impartially strengthening social cohesion in the affected areas.

The selection criteria will include
-	Inclusion: This sector will primarily target the general need of shelter of the vulnerable population affected by the blast while ensuring the inclusion of different age groups, gender and diversity, ESPECIALLY THE DISPLACED AND MIGRANT WORKER POPULATIONS.
-	Targeted assistance to the most vulnerable households: Caritas will determine eligibility based on the needs assessment reports set out by UN Habitat and LRC. Special attention will be given to
o	Female headed households
o	Elderlies
o	Household with PWD
o	Household with dead family member
o	Household with heavily injured member
-	Coordination with local actors: Understanding the holistic needs of affected communities requires inter-sectoral collaboration. Shelter assistance will be coordinated between partners within the sector and with activities of other sectors for improved impact and complementarity of interventions where applicable, including but not limited to protection and health concerns.

This project aims to conduct contractor-led immediate stabilisation of structurally damaged residential buildings that are already evacuated, and includes those which still present an immediate threat to life at community level through risk of collapse of architectural (balconies, rooves, NON-LOAD-BEARING WALLS) or load-bearing (foundations, walls, columns) elements in Beirut Municipality. Targetting 100 buildings (or around 9% of all Level 3 damaged buildings as per the Shelter sector's appeal needs calculations), the flash appeal scope over 3 months is seen as part of a longer 18 month scope for structural repairs. The proposed work builds on UN-Habitat's experience in repairing and rehabilitating structurally unsound heritage buildings accommodating vulnerable households in Saida and Tripoli in 2019. The current financial proposal is for immediate works COSTING 20% of the total structural repair cost. THE PER BUILDING COST OVER THE 3 MONTH FLASH APPEAL PERIOD IS $18,000, NOTING THAT EACH BUILDING IN THE TARGET AREAS (MAR MIKHAEL, KARANTINA) ACCOMMODATE APPROXIMATELY 8 HOUSEHOLDS [IE 100 BUILDINGS WITH 8 HH PER BUILDING = 800HH;  4 INDIVIDUALS PER HH = 3200 INDIVIDUALS], and that these areas contain concentrations of heritage structures which are both more expensive to address and more likely to have suffered sever damage. RESOURCE mobilisation for the remaining 80% IS underway. DONOR DISCUSSIONS ON a parallel initiative to undertake minor repairs in households in lightly damaged buildings (100 units) amounting to $0.128M  are at ADVANCED STAGES.

For the structurally unsound  buildings, the scope includes modern and heritage buildings in reflection of the building mix of the target area of Mar Mikhael & Karantina AS two of the most affected areas. In-house architectural and engineering expertise on structural works for heritage buildings will be utilised as needed. The project is geographically aligned to a blast-related CERF-funded ($800k) project UN-Habitat has already commenced with implementing partner PCPM on conditional cash for rent in Mar Mikhael (primary area) and Karantina (secondary area, anticipated gapfilling in soft collaboration with NRC); operational complementarities to meet the cash for rent needs of households evacuated from unsound buildings  will be addressed directly  through the CERF project and if necessary topped up through referrals. For the minor repairs, it is anticipated that buildings at some distance from the immediate blast zone will be targetted, in coordination with the Shelter sector,

Targetting of buildings will be based on
(1) Beirut Municipality Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA) survey of all buildings (which has been facilitated by UN-Habitat); 
(2) Field and phone survey of  occupiers of buildings surveyed (undertaken by UN-Habitat) in RDA that are evacuated or are to be evacuated;
(3) Emerging COMPREHENSIVE AND detailed assessments of damaged buildings by Order of Architects & Engineers IN BEIRUT MUNICIPALITY; 
(4) Household-level multisectoral needs analysis data from LRC.

The project will capitalise on UN-Habitat's links with the Order of Architects & Engineers as well as its staff presence currently embedded in Beirut Municipality Emergency Cell to engage in capacity-building on the shelter response to structural unsoundness, specifically at the levels of technical surveying and information management, technical works in the field and HLP awareness-raising to support the housing rights of evacuees among related issues. The HLP training will integrate gender sensitisation, reflecting the Shelter sector's prioritisation of female-headed households in particular.",,,"Support 100 most vulnerable families in Bourj Hammoud in conducting minor repairs to their houses damaged by the Blast Improve community safety & accelerate the return of displaced households to their homes through rapid stabilization of evacuated structurally damaged residential buildings as a precursor to structural repair.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.  As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.  The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021).

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.  As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.  The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021). Potential drought conditions will likely develop as a result of below average 2020 Deyr (Oct-Dec), a harsh 2021 dry Jilaal (Jan-Mar) season and a possible delay and/or poor performance of the 2021 Gu (Apr-Jun).

Specifically, the project will target 228,000 Nondisplaced people (children 107,160; men 41,040; women 36,480; elderly 9,120 and disabled 34,200) and 152,000 displaced populations (children 71,440; men 27,360; women 24,320; elderly 6,080 and disabled 22,800). 

IOM will rehabilitate 50 strategic water sources for multi-use that will provide continued, equitable, safe, sufficient and sustainable water to regions, targeted by the cluster, prone to natural disasters. 

IOM further proposes to construct 3,000 new emergency sanitation facilities (following cluster specifications) targeting populations without access to basic sanitation and hygiene.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Members States, community leaders and water committees/technicians for better coordination with government authorities and communities and sustainability of the constructed/ rehabilitated WASH infrastructures. In addition, the project will nurture community participation in good hygiene practices through training and community sensitization campaigns.

IOM WASH is proposing to contribute to the continuation and restoration of access to safe and equitable basic WASH services to overall 380,000 beneficiaries from vulnerable IDP and host-communities in multiple regions in Somalia. 

Specifically, the project will target 228,000 Nondisplaced people (children 107,160; men 41,040; women 36,480; elderly 9,120 and disabled 34,200) and 152,000 displaced populations (children 71,440; men 27,360; women 24,320; elderly 6,080 and disabled 22,800). 

IOM will rehabilitate 50 strategic water sources for multi-use that will provide continued, equitable, safe, sufficient and sustainable water to regions, targeted by the cluster, prone to natural disasters. 

IOM further proposes to construct 3,000 new emergency sanitation facilities (following cluster specifications) targeting populations without access to basic sanitation and hygiene.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Members States, community leaders and water committees/technicians for better coordination with government authorities and communities and sustainability of the constructed/ rehabilitated WASH infrastructures. In addition, the project will nurture community participation in good hygiene practices through training and community sensitization campaigns.

Somalia’s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks including desert locust upsurge that started in late 2019 in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts. Based on the cumulative, combined impacts of multiple shocks, FSNAU and FEWS NET projected in May 2020 that around 3.5 million Somalis would be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) through at least September 2020. An additional 3 million Somalis were anticipated to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and engaging in negative coping strategies to meet their food and non-food needs. Analysis of household food security survey data collected in the July/August 2020 post-Gu assessment resulted in reduced estimates through December 2020. However, anticipated La Niña conditions are associated with an elevated likelihood of consecutive below-average rainfall seasons, and Somalia faces a high risk that drought conditions will develop by early 2021 while desert locusts could exacerbate crop and pasture losses. As a result, a high proportion of the population that is projected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2) in October-December 2020 could deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in early 2021. The Food Security Cluster projects an average of 3.5 million Somalis to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) through 2021.

Against the above background, the purpose of the proposed project is that the food security situation of vulnerable and affected households in Somaliland is stabilized and households are more resilient towards drought, desert locusts scourge and other shocks. Specifically, the proposed project will contribute to two objectives including; 1: Improving access  to food through conditional and unconditional transfers and 2: Provide seasonal livelihood inputs support (agriculture and livestock). These will be achieved through conditional and unconditional cash transfers, rehabilitation of communal assets and agricultural inputs support. 

Target beneficiaries 
The project will target at risk and affected populations in rural areas including farmers, agro pastoralists, pastoralists and rural IDPs and host communities to whom humanitarian assistance is key to prevent them from further deterioration of their food security and nutrition situation. In total the project will target 1,450 households  (10,150 individuals) in the districts of  Owdweyne in Togdheer region and Talex and Xudun in Sool regions of Eastern Somaliland and Zeylac district in Awdal region of Western Somaliland. Priority will be given to households headed by disabled persons or elderly persons without support, poor female-headed households, poor households with malnourished children under 5 years and poor pregnant and lactating women, who are at increased risk of malnutrition. The project will be implemented between January to December 2021. 

The criteria for selection of the beneficiaries will be guided by food insecurity levels (IPC 3 and 4, based on latest FEWSNET and FSNAU analysis), Structural vulnerability or social status including minority groups, IDPs, women or child headed households, elderly or persons with disability, and families with malnourished children under 5 years ",,TRUE,"Improving immediate access to food while restoring livelihoods among the under-served communities in Sanag region.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.  As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.  The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021).

An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021). Potential drought conditions will likely develop as a result of below average 2020 Deyr (Oct-Dec), a harsh 2021 dry Jilaal (Jan-Mar) season and a possible delay and/or poor performance of the 2021 Gu (Apr-Jun). 

Continued emergency relief alongside a further scale up of support to increase resilience is required in order to avert the hardship situation. WFP is therefore seeking resources in 2021 to sustain the on-going efforts and enable households meet immediate food needs and help build resilience against shocks. WFP is planning to implement unconditional and conditional transfers to improve access to food under integrated multi sectoral assistance to meet needs of vulnerable girls and women, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men and leverage resources with other partners to meet the level of humanitarian assistance required. WFP will continue to participate in cluster, joint planning, assessments and regular meetings with other humanitarian actors in Somalia. WFP employs gender sensitive beneficiary targeting in all its projects and prioritizes female and single headed households. Community consultations are carried out with men and women to ensure that their voices are heard. Accountability to affected populations ensured through information sharing, surveys and beneficiary feedback mechanisms.

",,TRUE,"Emergency food aid for refugees, internally displaced persons and host communities in accordance with Strategic Objective 1 of the WFP country program (excluding UNHAS flights) WFP SOMALIA 2022 HRP - FSC Somalia has been impacted by multiple shocks in 2020, including desert locust invasion, flash floods and COVID-19. This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

IOM WASH is proposing to contribute to the continuation and restoration of access to safe and equitable basic WASH services to overall 380,000 beneficiaries from vulnerable IDP and host-communities in multiple regions in Somalia. 

Specifically, the project will target 228,000 Nondisplaced people (children 107,160; men 41,040; women 36,480; elderly 9,120 and disabled 34,200) and 152,000 displaced populations (children 71,440; men 27,360; women 24,320; elderly 6,080 and disabled 22,800). 

IOM will rehabilitate 50 strategic water sources for multi-use that will provide continued, equitable, safe, sufficient and sustainable water to regions, targeted by the cluster, prone to natural disasters. 

IOM further proposes to construct 3,000 new emergency sanitation facilities (following cluster specifications) targeting populations without access to basic sanitation and hygiene.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Members States, community leaders and water committees/technicians for better coordination with government authorities and communities and sustainability of the constructed/ rehabilitated WASH infrastructures. In addition, the project will nurture community participation in good hygiene practices through training and community sensitization campaigns.  All trainings, awareness raising and capacity building activities will follow national guidelines on COVID-19 preventive measures, e.g. on physical distancing, to avoid mass gatherings and minimize risks of exposure.

The project is aligned with protection mainstreaming to ensure safety and dignity of affected populations without causing harm. Affected populations and all relevant stakeholders including men, women, boys, girls, elderly and people with disability will be involved in decision making throughout the project activities/cycle. 

Furthermore, the project will be a part of an IOM integrated emergency response program and resilience building, where possible, efforts will be made to integrate IOM health, nutrition, shelter, CCCM and protection activities.

About 91,259 children (36,504F; 54,756M) are estimated to be in schools, while 162,239 are out of school children (OOSC) and 1,381 are IDP children with disability (CWD). In Diinsoor, 14,112 are primary school aged children, among those only 3,135 (1,163F; 1,972M) are enrolled in 8 primary schools, with 10,977 being OOSC and 226 CWD. In Ceel-barde there are 1,720 primary school aged children, with only 698 (414M;312F) enrolled in 3 public and IDP schools, while 1,032 (568M; 464F) are OOSC and 50 children are CWD. In Xudur, only 4,384 children (2,436M;1,948F) are currently enrolled in the 16 public and IDP schools, while 10,692 children (5,988M; 4,705F) remain out of schools and 151 are CWD (FCA needs assessment 09-10/20).

Major findings of FCA assessments in the four districts showed enormous shortage of accessible and gender friendly infrastructure such as latrines, handwashing facilities and classrooms, lack of learning and teaching materials, and inadequate number of qualified teachers especially female teachers. Girls face tremendous barriers in accessing to education due social norms that restrict their enrolment, retention and movement. The existing education system also reflects the persistence of these norms and does little to promote change in perception, attitude and behaviours. Children with disabilities met significant challenges such as strong stigma, discrimination and misconceptions, limited disability friendly infrastructure, poor learning environment and lack of specialised teachers trained in special education needs. Caregivers also faced with challenges in covering foods, school fees, uniforms and scholastic materials. Many of IDP children face significant health risks and psychological distress. Child protection and safeguarding mechanisms in schools are weak, due to lack of protection knowledge and relevant trainings among key education personnel. This has compromised the safety and well-being of the children, especially for girls and CWD in accessing education. 

Aligning with the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan, Education Sector Strategic Plan and Covid-19 Emergency Response Plan for Education, the initiative aims to restore and maintain access to safe, protective, inclusive and continuous learning opportunities for crises and emergency affected primary school boys and girls in Bay and Bakool regions of South West State of Somalia. The project will put a strong emphasis on an integrated approach to education focusing on access, quality of education, protection, child safeguarding, gender equality, conflict sensitivity, and disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the design, approach and activities. 

The project will remove barriers to primary education for 7,365 affected children (3,314F;4,051M), prioritising children from the most vulnerable groups such as IDPs, girls, CWD and destitute host community children. About 736 children with disability (331F;405M) will also be targeted (10%). Particularly, 40% IDP children, 60% destitute host community children and 45% of girls will benefit from the support.
 
FCA will partner with GREDO to implement some components of the project, particularly in relation to rehabilitation and construction of infrastructure, community mobilisation and protection mechanisms in schools. FCA will engage Somalia Institute for Special Education Needs and Disability (SISEN) for capacity building on inclusion and SEN for teachers, MoE and other education personnel. 

FCA has excellent capacity to scale up the approach and apply best practice in the four target locations built on its ongoing EiE response in Bay and Bakool regions and solid expertise as a well-known and trusted Finnish education actor.

IOM will rehabilitate 50 strategic water sources for multi-use that will provide continued, equitable, safe, sufficient and sustainable water to regions, targeted by the cluster, prone to natural disasters. 

IOM further proposes to construct 3,000 new emergency sanitation facilities (following cluster specifications) targeting populations without access to basic sanitation and hygiene.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Members States, community leaders and water committees/technicians for better coordination with government authorities and communities and sustainability of the constructed/ rehabilitated WASH infrastructures. In addition, the project will nurture community participation in good hygiene practices through training and community sensitization campaigns.  All trainings, awareness raising and capacity building activities will follow national guidelines on COVID-19 preventive measures, e.g. on physical distancing, to avoid mass gatherings and minimize risks of exposure.

The project is aligned with protection mainstreaming to ensure safety and dignity of affected populations without causing harm.

In 2020, over 4.6 million people (1.16 million IDPs and 3.36 million host communities) don’t have sufficient quantity of water and adequate sanitation (HNO 2020). This dire situation is even worsened by the COVID19 pandemic which require more water for frequent handwashing for prevention and containment. Schools in Somalia are reopening and due to COVID19, a number of schools are requesting urgent water supply for both students consumption and to support frequent handwashing. 

The water supply coverage in Somalia is strongly dependent on rainfall performance. In the last two rainy seasons namely 2019 Dayr and 2020 Gu, the performance of rains has improved slightly (SWALIM/FAO). From 2017 onwards, the water coverage has shown slight improvement due to improved rain performance. The National WASH Cluster estimates 59% as having sufficient drinking water with 66% of those with access walk less than 15 minutes for a water point and 20% having challenges to access the minimum quantity of safe water.

On the other hand, Oxfam needs assessment conducted late 2019 in Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions indicates that over 40% of both IDP and host communities rely on purchasing water from commercial trucks. There is no well-organized and reliable government data that shows the coverage of water, sanitation, and hygiene in Somalia. In December 2019 and January 2020, Oxfam and FAO/SWALIM conducted a WASH inventory in all regions of Somaliland. The inventory focused on sustainable and strategic water sources in the country including boreholes, springs, and protected shallow wells. The functionality of these sources is critical. However, the current functionality rate is estimated to be much below 70% and decreases as the stress level goes up during the drought period. The analysis of the final report is not yet finalized but expected to inform the sector on ways to increase functionality and reduce interruption of services. The COVID19 outbreak has increased the need for water to support frequent handwashing practices and this will further stress the few existing water sources. 
People living in the riverine areas in Somalia and other areas adjusted to seasonal rivers are affected by floods. The worst most recent flash-floods were reported from the Shabelle river basin particularly in Beletwayn town, Hiraan Region, and Qardho town of Puntland State. Until the end of May 2020, over 412,000 people are displaced by the floods (UNOCHA, Flood Bulletin). The capacity of regional states and the federal government is limited only to response instead of constructing large scale flood protection structures. 

Somalia is one of the worst hit Horn of African countries by COVID19. So far, over to 3,864 cases and 99 deaths are recorded. However, the figures are believed to be much higher since testing capacity is limited to only few major towns. The situation in Somalia is different compared to other countries with a strong governance system in the horn of Africa. Only 31% of people in Somalia reported having a functional handwashing facility with soap (WASH Cluster, March 2020). This estimate is based on an assessment conducted before the Covid19 lockdown. The federal government and humanitarian agencies confirmed the increased market price of soap and other detergents and 11% contraction of national GDP in the country. Covid19 prevention requires frequent handwashing and social distancing which both are difficult in Somalia context.

Women and girls continued to report protection-related risk",,TRUE,"SOMALIA - Multisectoral humanitarian aid in western, central and eastern Africa (2021 portion) Humanitarian WASH Response in Somaliland and Puntland Regions, Somalia  Unreliable access to a temporary and/or inadequate WASH facility remains an important feature of the humanitarian landscape in Somalia. In 2020, over 4.6 million people (1.16 million IDPs and 3.36 million host communities) don’t have sufficient quantity of water and adequate sanitation (HNO 2020). This dire situation is even worsened by the COVID19 pandemic which require more water for frequent handwashing for prevention and containment. Schools in Somalia are reopening and due to COVID19, a number of schools are requesting urgent water supply for both students consumption and to support frequent handwashing. 

The water supply coverage in Somalia is strongly dependent on rainfall performance. In the last two rainy seasons namely 2019 Dayr and 2020 Gu, the performance of rains has improved slightly (SWALIM/FAO). From 2017 onwards, the water coverage has shown slight improvement due to improved rain performance. The National WASH Cluster estimates 59% as having sufficient drinking water with 66% of those with access walk less than 15 minutes for a water point and 20% having challenges to access the minimum quantity of safe water. (JMCNA ). 48% access their own improved latrines, while 52% use either unimproved latrines or practicing open defecation (22%) posing a huge public health risk.

Somalia continues to face a dire humanitarian situation, with an estimated 5.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. This is attributed to cumulative shocks, including erratic 2020 Gu season, widespread and severe seasonal flooding, desert locust infestation, socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 and protracted conflict and flood-related displacements.

According to the 2020 Post Gu Seasonal Food Security and Nutrition Analysis for September (FAO/FSNAU), an estimated 1.3 million people are facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes through September 2020. This number is expected to increase to 2.1 million people through December 2020, in the absence of humanitarian assistance. An additional 2.5 million people are Stressed (IPC Phase 2), bringing the total number of people experiencing acute food insecurity to 3.8 million. In addition, 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition over the next 12 months (September 2020 to August 2021), including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

The ongoing Deyr rains in parts of central regions of Galmudug pose a high risk of flash flooding especially in low-lying areas. In Baxda village, Caddado district, Mudug region, one person died following heavy rains that collapsed their house. According to a multi-agency assessment in Adado district in May 2020, about 1,350 IDP households and 350 households from vulnerable host community need food security intervention. Seasonal Hagaa flooding since July has resulted in the displacement of nearly 342,000 people, inundated 294 villages and destroyed property and about 15,000 to 20,000 hectares of assorted crops, mainly in rural areas along the Shabelle river valley according to the UNHCR-led Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN) in Somalia. 

Desert locusts continue to cause havoc in different parts of Somalia. In Galmudug, adult locusts continue to spread in rural villages in Galkacyo, Hobyo, Cabudwaaq, Cadaado, and Dhuusamarreeb. The locust problem has a wide range of impacts that worry Galmudug pastoralist as the region’s economic mainstay is livestock rearing. The locust will have a long-term impact on grazing lands and the poor performance of the rainy seasons may lead to depletion of pasture and acceleration of the dry season. 

CPD plans to reach 23,400 people facing severe acute food insecurity in Galmudug, Benadir and Lower Shabelle regions, mainly IDPs and host communities affected by the impacts of floods, desert locusts, conflicts and socio-economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic by improving access to food through unconditional and conditional transfers. Weak, vulnerable members of the IDPs and the host communities such as women and child-headed households, people with disability and the elderly will receive unconditional support through mobile cash transfers as per the CWG recommended transfer values per region (Benadir $70, Galgadud $110, Lower Shabelle $60, Mudug $80).  The men and the youth will be engaged in conditional transfers e.g. cash/food-for-work for livelihood interventions that will support community recover their livelihood and meet their immediate needs. Activities include rehabilitation and establishment of community infrastructure such as water catchments i.e. water pans.

CPD will protect and restore livelihoods related to food and income sources for the target communities through skills training to increase household income; rehabilitation and support for productive capacities of communities through agricultural inputs (e.g. quality seed, farm tools, training, land preparation and irrigation support) and livelihood strengthening and diversification (e.g. fishing).

Project will be inclusive by incorporating people with disability, women, youth and marginalized groups in all project phases in the target areas. Covid-19 measures and guidelines will be incorporated in project implementation.

Nearly 20 percent of the total 2.7 million people in need of food assistance did not access it, including in riverine and rural areas of the South, where humanitarian access is low. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Somali economy is significant. Poor urban and IDP households, as well as pastoralists in northern Somalia, are likely to be most affected by an estimated 30-50 percent decline in annual external remittances, anticipated 25-35 percent decline in annual livestock exports, lower labor demand, and above-average imported staple food prices. In most IDP settlements and urban areas, at least 20 percent of the population still face food consumption gaps or are engaged in negative livelihoods coping strategies indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) even after food assistance distributions. Additionally, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeastern Somalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports.

During the July to September dry season, up to 3.5 million people are anticipated to be unable to meet their minimum food needs and in need of urgent humanitarian food assistance. Further, the NOAA/CPC NMME forecast predicts an increased likelihood of a below-average deyr rainfall season from October to December 2020. FEWS NET’S research shows the NMME forecast has a strong capability to predict below-average rainfall during the October to December rainfall season in eastern East Africa. Combined with the persistent threat of desert locust, the impact of below-average rains on crop and livestock production is expected to lead to widespread deterioration to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in northern and central pastoral areas and southern agropastoral areas in the absence of sustained food assistance.

Among the target beneficiaries will be 2,308 persons with disabilities (1177 male, 1131 female).
The below-average rainfall forecast for the upcoming Deyr season (Oct to Dec) which may be compounded by a harsh Jilaal dry season in 2021 calls for a greater focus on WASH and a re-prioritization of life-saving approaches in Gedo. Access to improved water sources remains low in Gedo with a significant portion of the population relying on the rivers and other seasonal streams as their primary water sources. A joint multi-sectoral assessment led by Trócaire in Dollow riverine communities in December 2019 indicated that 90% of households consume untreated water from the Juba river. The same assessment identified poor latrine coverage as a challenge, with 80% of the population lacking access to latrines. This results in wider open defecation, which is suspected to be one of the factors contributing to the frequent occurrence of diarrheal diseases in the area. A detailed site assessment by REACH in February 2020 further reported widespread open defecation at 64 and 100 percent respectively in assessed sites in Luuq and Dollow. The most severely affected community members are women and girls, who are often forced to use nearby bushes, putting them at a greater risk of SGBV. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded WASH needs in communities, with Trocaire noting serious gaps in knowledge, skills and resources to prevent and control the pandemic especially in IDP and rural communities. 
The project aims to contribute to the achievement of specific objectives of the WASH cluster: delivering life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute needs, and restoring access to safe and equitable basic WASH services in target locations. This will be done through the construction of one (1) solar powered shallow well with piping to communities in Dollow, rehabilitation of one flood-damaged water system in Dollow and provision of Genset, construction of 110 permanent gender-sensitive latrines with handwashing stations, desludging of 85 latrines, hygiene promotion sessions with distribution of hygiene kits, and environmental cleanup campaigns. In addition, Trocaire will conduct water testing and treatment of water facilities in target locations, and conduct trainings and refresher trainings for representative Water Management Committees while equipping them with tools necessary for effective management of water points. Trocaire will collaborate with Somali Humanitarian Relief Action (SHRA) and Active in Development Aid (ADA), national NGOs with strong experience in implementing WASH projects in Gedo, in delivery of this project in the four target districts.
Trocaire shall work closely with local partners identified to promote protection of beneficiaries and ensure access to services especially for people living with disabilities. The Water Management Committees will particularly be sensitized on inclusivity in water access for people with disabilities and their families. Hygiene promotion outreach teams will be trained to identify and deliver services in homes with people living with disabilities. Gender inclusivity will be ensured through creation or support to adequately representative community structures, as well as working closely with women groups in target location.

In addition, Trocaire will conduct water testing and treatment of water facilities in target locations, and conduct trainings and refresher trainings for representative Water Management Committees while equipping them with tools necessary for effective management of water points. Trocaire will collaborate with Somali Humanitarian Relief Action (SHRA) and Active in Development Aid (ADA), national NGOs with strong experience in implementing WASH projects in Gedo, in delivery of this project in the four target districts.
Trocaire shall work closely with local partners identified to promote protection of beneficiaries and ensure access to services especially for people living with disabilities. The Water Management Committees will particularly be sensitized on inclusivity in water access for people with disabilities and their families. Hygiene promotion outreach teams will be trained to identify and deliver services in homes with people living with disabilities. Gender inclusivity will be ensured through creation or support to adequately representative community structures, as well as working closely with women groups in target location. All data collected will be dis aggregated by gender, age and disability, to inform adaptive programming in meeting the different needs of the different social groups reached.

Climate shocks including drought and flooding as well as ongoing conflict contributes to internal displacement in Somalia, with an estimated 2.6M men, women, girls and boys who are currently displaced. This people/ IDPs are now living in IDP camps with lack of enough basic services including shelter, The 2020 Gu’ Season flooding has caused several displacement, damage of properties, housing, farmland and social amenities and also Massive displacement especially in the river rine areas of Middle Lower Shabelle areas. 
This areas are also prone to conflict crises particularly in South Central Somalia where part of it is under al-shabaab control hence contributes to more displacement and increase the need of the IDPs who were already in need 0f basic services, this also contributes to the protection concerns of vulnerable groups e.g. women, girls and  people with specific needs and also people with disabilities.
 Through this project, Juba Foundation aims to address the humanitarian needs of the displaced IDPs and poor host communities in poor shelter conditions in south central Somalia.
The project will focus on improving the lives & dignity of IDPs and poor host communities across Somalia through the provision of locally purchased Non food items (NFIs) Emergency shelter kits (Esks) through in-kind distribution where feasible and if there is functional market with shelter and NFI materials cash or voucher can be an option. But at the moment Juba Foundation is Flexible to use either cash or in-kind Distribution. 
For the beneficiaries’ selection and registration, juba foundation will give consideration to the female headed Household. People with specific needs among other households. The host communities will also be given consideration with selection of 20 – 30 %, similarly 15% will be selected from persons with disabilities in each project.
Juba Foundation will ensure the affected population will have full protection and improve their dignity and living conditions through the provision of appropriate emergency shelter kits (Esks) for each household will receive ESK( type 2 with a size of 4.4m x 3.6m)  depending on land availability. For the provision of NFIs each household will be provided with one NFI kit as per the cluster guidelines along with the Esks.

Many IDPs in protracted displacement remain in situations with no progress towards durable solutions and suffer from systemic marginalization. Access to life-saving assistance and basic services, such as education and health, exclusion from services provided by government are other factors that contribute to heightened protection risks faced by displaced and other conflict-affected populations. Sexual and gender-based violence also remains a critical protection concern for IDPs. A significant proportion of IDPs are members of minority groups lacking the protection of major clans. COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated pre-existing risks and vulnerabilities. In Somalia internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been facing despicable acts of man-made violence including forced evictions and natural hazards which have led to multiple displacement and limited access to durable solution opportunities. Many newly displaced IDPs still remain in need of assistance. Many of the IDPs reside in overcrowded areas with poor living conditions and limited security provision. The basic needs of IDPs are often not met due to inconsistent service provision, exclusion from accessing services, or from the sheer absence of services due to poor targeting of settlements. Forced evictions remain one of the most severe and prevalent protection threats, particularly for IDPs and poor households, due to an underdeveloped regulatory framework, hampered access to justice, low awareness of and respect for HLP rights, and a weak protective environment. It is anticipated that opening of the borders and lifting some of the COVID-19 travel restrictions can lead to an increase of number of returns as compared to 2020 that will bring overall number of returnees in the Somalia that will be in need of variety of protection services to 109,989. Many returnees choose not to return to their areas of origin, preferring to settle in urban areas. Many of these contribute to and suffer the results of pressure on basic services, further compounded by recurrent influxes of IDPs. Any intervention will be vulnerability and needs based.

Assessment conducted by OCHA in 2020 in collaboration with other UN organizations/agencies has unfold a gloomy picture of the health systems which also comes with some noticeable geographic disparities;  for instance;

- Only 32.9% of deliveries take place in health facilities and 27.7% of post-natal care is provided by trained health staff. Recent estimates reveal that over 2.2 million people have limited or no access to essential health care services including women at reproductive age (15-49 years)

The above situation is aggravated by:
- The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan has increased burden on the already weak health system. Many of the existing resources (human, equipment, infrastructure, funds etc) have been diverted to support COVID-19 response. This and the additional financial resources allocated from routine health programmes have impacted negatively on the delivery of health services particularly those entrapped in protracted crises, such as, Afghan Refugees and Temporary displaced persons.   
- The non-pharmaceutical response to COVID-19 especially restriction to movements have adversely  affected  access to health services by the disaster affected population because repeated lockdowns with resultant supply chain breakdowns not only hampered services availability but also restricted population access to these services - Since, Health sector workforce including doctors from public and private sector, nurses, paramedics staff and pharmaceutical experts, lab technicians are at the forefront of Coronavirus.

10%-20% decline in service coverage of essential maternal health care (ANC and post-natal care) may result in increasing of maternal deaths up to 2,056 -3,135 cases respectively.
There was not a tangible decline in institutional deliveries observed in the provinces where UNFPA mobile units are functional.  However, the number of ANC and Postnatal visits decreased by 30% due to lockdown and accessibility of the services. 
Distribution of COVID 19 positive cases among male and female population is unequal in different age groups. Most prevalent cases observed among male population in middle age group (65%).

Assessment conducted by OCHA in 2020 in collaboration with other UN organizations/agencies has unfold a gloomy picture of the health systems which also comes with some noticeable geographic disparities;  for instance; 
- Only 26.9% of the health facilities in Sajawal were having medicine available and on the other hand 88.9% of the health facilities in TM Khan were having medicine available in the health facility.
- Only 32.9% of deliveries take place in health facilities and 27.7% of post-natal care is provided by trained health staff. Recent estimates reveal that over 2.2 million people have limited or no access to essential health care services including women at reproductive age (15-49 years) 
- Access to health facilities by pregnant women is poor. For instance, only 52% in TM Khan and 28.2% in Sajawal have access to a health facility that assisting with birth 24/7, (Joint UN assessment 2020). 

Overall, 27% of the health facilities were reported as nonfunctional in the flood affected communities. Out of the functional health facilities only 27% providing 24/7 health care services. Overall, 52% of the respondents reported medicine available at the nearest health facilities, while 48% reported medicine were not available at the health facility.
The above situation is aggravated by:
- The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan has increased burden on the already weak health system. Many of the existing resources (human, equipment, infrastructure, funds etc) have been diverted to support COVID-19 response. This and the additional financial resources allocated from routine health programmes have impacted negatively on the delivery of health services particularly those entrapped in protracted crises, such as, Afghan Refugees and Temporary displaced persons.   
- The non-pharmaceutical response to COVID-19 especially restriction to movements have adversely  affected  access to health services by the disaster affected population because repeated lockdowns with resultant supply chain breakdowns not only hampered services availability but also restricted population access to these services - Since, Health sector workforce including doctors from public and private sector, nurses, paramedics staff and pharmaceutical experts, lab technicians are at the forefront of Coronavirus.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.  As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.  The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021). Potential drought conditions will likely develop as a result of below average 2020 Deyr (Oct-Dec), a harsh 2021 dry Jilaal (Jan-Mar) season and a possible delay and/or poor performance of the 2021 Gu (Apr-Jun). 

Continued emergency relief alongside a further scale up of support to increase resilience is required in order to avert the hardship situation. WFP is therefore seeking resources in 2021 to sustain the on-going efforts and enable households meet immediate food needs and help build resilience against shocks. WFP is planning to implement unconditional and conditional transfers to improve access to food under integrated multi sectoral assistance to meet needs of vulnerable girls and women, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men and leverage resources with other partners to meet the level of humanitarian assistance required. WFP will continue to participate in cluster, joint planning, assessments and regular meetings with other humanitarian actors in Somalia.

The project aims to strengthen a rights-based protection response for IDPs and non-IDP communities, as well as refugee returnees, in particular those most vulnerable through stronger advocacy, life-saving protection and assistance activities, evidence-based programming with the focus on developing and building the capacity of affected communities to cope and recover and better position them for the attainment of durable solutions. Improving coordination and quality of assessments and monitoring will also be key components of the project. The project also foresees benefiting the entire displaced population through continuous advocacy and support in the area of Law and Policy, fostering the successful engagement with relevant authorities and partners with a focus on the approval and implementation of the new IDP Law. This activity will be built upon efforts by UNHCR that in 2020 culminated in the Somalia accession to Kampala Convention and development of draft IDP Law that is aimed to domesticate it.   
UNHCR will continue to make the best of its key membership of the protection cluster and ensure regular reporting to the clusters’ 5Ws and strong participation and contribution in the different clusters’ working groups to ensure coordination and complementarity of interventions, avoiding duplication with other members and ensuring regular sharing of protection reports with the cluster. 
Many IDPs in protracted displacement remain in situations with no progress towards durable solutions and suffer from systemic marginalization. Access to life-saving assistance and basic services, such as education and health, exclusion from services provided by government are other factors that contribute to heightened protection risks faced by displaced and other conflict-affected populations. Sexual and gender-based violence also remains a critical protection concern for IDPs. A significant proportion of IDPs are members of minority groups lacking the protection of major clans. COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated pre-existing risks and vulnerabilities. In Somalia internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been facing despicable acts of man-made violence including forced evictions and natural hazards which have led to multiple displacement and limited access to durable solution opportunities. Many newly displaced IDPs still remain in need of assistance. Many of the IDPs reside in overcrowded areas with poor living conditions and limited security provision. The basic needs of IDPs are often not met due to inconsistent service provision, exclusion from accessing services, or from the sheer absence of services due to poor targeting of settlements. Forced evictions remain one of the most severe and prevalent protection threats, particularly for IDPs and poor households, due to an underdeveloped regulatory framework, hampered access to justice, low awareness of and respect for HLP rights, and a weak protective environment. It is anticipated that opening of the borders and lifting some of the COVID-19 travel restrictions can lead to an increase of number of returns as compared to 2020 that will bring overall number of returnees in the Somalia that will be in need of variety of protection services to 109,989. Many returnees choose not to return to their areas of origin, preferring to settle in urban areas. Many of these contribute to and suffer the results of pressure on basic services, further compounded by recurrent influxes of IDPs. Any intervention will be vulnerability and needs based.  While there is increased effort to promote sustainable return and re-integration, a substantial number of returnees have limited access to basic services, precarious or no physical security and are constantly exposed to myriad protection risks that proposed project will seek to address.

Based on latest projections, 2.1 million Somalis are in IPC Phases 3 and above through December 2020. Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of the La Nina developing, which tends to trigger dry conditions in Somalia. If the forecast below-average Deyr rains (Oct-Dec 2020) is followed by below-average or delayed 2021 Gu rains (Apr-Jun), this could lead to a rapid and substantial worsening of the humanitarian situation. 

Rural populations are at a high risk of further deteriorating food security, given the direct and indirect impacts of these threats on rural livelihoods, related assets, food production and income. FAO’s proposal responds both to the lifesaving and life-sustaining needs of rural populations in IPC Phases 3 and above, against a Population in Need (PiN) of 3.1 million people prioritized for Food Security Cluster (FSC) assistance under the 2021 HRP. FAO’s planned activities will directly support 103,850 households in IPC 3-4 under both FSC Strategic Objectives (SOs), while further delivering support to protect food security in Somalia at a wider scale through countrywide animal health campaigns, among other activities. 

Under SO1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 76,300 rural households, including IDPs, in the form of Cash+, UCT and CFW activities delivered through FAO’s e-Platform for Mobile Money and Livelihood Assistance. All cash-based programmes include trainings on good nutrition practices, covering infancy to old age.

Under SO2, to protect livelihoods, FAO will provide in-kind and technical support to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security threats across Somalia’s rural livelihood zones, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to 53,500 households targeted for Cash+ interventions under SO1 (while supporting an additional 7,550 households with agricultural inputs only). FAO’s planned Cash+ activities combine cash transfers with tailored livelihood support packages to assist rural families out of hunger sooner. Alongside cash transfers, the assistance packages will protect and restore the livelihoods of households in IPC Phases 3-4 by providing: (i) farmers with quality inputs to produce a nutritious variety of food crop (cereal, pulse and vegetable seeds, storage bags, fertilizer and irrigation/tractor services, where appropriate; (ii) pastoralists with nutrient-rich feed blocks and deworming to improve livestock productivity especially milk supply; and (iii) coastal communities with a variety of basic fishing gear and processing equipment to improve catch and consumption.  

Also under SO2, in anticipation of drought conditions in early 2021, FAO will also strategically position water bladder tanks and provide nutritive animal feed blocks to protect the small milking animals of up to 20,000 pastoral households impacted by scarce pasture from dry conditions and/or locust damage. Countrywide livestock vaccination and supportive treatment campaigns will further protect livestock assets belonging to at least 2.2 million men, women and children. Preparedness for animal health emergencies will be enhanced through strategic stocking of vaccines and related supplies (PPR), and training to local partners in Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS), antimicrobial resistance, disease surveillance and reporting, among others.

Based on latest projections, 2.1 million Somalis are in IPC Phases 3 and above through December 2020. Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of the La Nina developing, which tends to trigger dry conditions in Somalia. If the forecast below-average Deyr rains (Oct-Dec 2020) is followed by below-average or delayed 2021 Gu rains (Apr-Jun), this could lead to a rapid and substantial worsening of the humanitarian situation. 

Rural populations are at a high risk of further deteriorating food security, given the direct and indirect impacts of these threats on rural livelihoods, related assets, food production and income. FAO’s proposal responds both to the lifesaving and life-sustaining needs of rural populations in IPC Phases 3 and above, against a Population in Need (PiN) of 3.1 million people prioritized for Food Security Cluster (FSC) assistance under the 2021 HRP. FAO’s planned activities will directly support 103,850 households in IPC 3-4 under both FSC Strategic Objectives (SOs), while further delivering support to protect food security in Somalia at a wider scale through countrywide animal health campaigns, among other activities. 

Under SO1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 76,300 rural households, including IDPs, in the form of Cash+, UCT and CFW activities delivered through FAO’s e-Platform for Mobile Money and Livelihood Assistance. All cash-based programmes include trainings on good nutrition practices, covering infancy to old age.

Under SO2, to protect livelihoods, FAO will provide in-kind and technical support to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security threats across Somalia’s rural livelihood zones, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to 53,500 households targeted for Cash+ interventions under SO1 (while supporting an additional 7,550 households with agricultural inputs only). FAO’s planned Cash+ activities combine cash transfers with tailored livelihood support packages to assist rural families out of hunger sooner. Alongside cash transfers, the assistance packages will protect and restore the livelihoods of households in IPC Phases 3-4 by providing: (i) farmers with quality inputs to produce a nutritious variety of food crop (cereal, pulse and vegetable seeds, storage bags, fertilizer and irrigation/tractor services, where appropriate; (ii) pastoralists with nutrient-rich feed blocks and deworming to improve livestock productivity especially milk supply; and (iii) coastal communities with a variety of basic fishing gear and processing equipment to improve catch and consumption.  

Also under SO2, in anticipation of drought conditions in early 2021, FAO will also strategically position water bladder tanks and provide nutritive animal feed blocks to protect the small milking animals of up to 20,000 pastoral households impacted by scarce pasture from dry conditions and/or locust damage. Countrywide livestock vaccination and supportive treatment campaigns will further protect livestock assets belonging to at least 2.2 million men, women and children. Preparedness for animal health emergencies will be enhanced through strategic stocking of vaccines and related supplies (PPR), and training to local partners in Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS), antimicrobial resistance, disease surveillance and reporting, among others.

There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices. 

Under FSC Objective 2, to protect livelihoods and related food sources, FAO will provide in-kind, technical support and tailored trainings to 112,500 HHs to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security and nutrition threats, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to targeted HHs. In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition.

There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions.

Specifically, the project will target 228,000 Nondisplaced people (children 107,160; men 41,040; women 36,480; elderly 9,120 and disabled 34,200) and 152,000 displaced populations (children 71,440; men 27,360; women 24,320; elderly 6,080 and disabled 22,800). 

IOM will rehabilitate 50 strategic water sources for multi-use that will provide continued, equitable, safe, sufficient and sustainable water to regions, targeted by the cluster, prone to natural disasters. 

IOM further proposes to construct 3,000 new emergency sanitation facilities (following cluster specifications) targeting populations without access to basic sanitation and hygiene.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Members States, community leaders and water committees/technicians for better coordination with government authorities and communities and sustainability of the constructed/ rehabilitated WASH infrastructures. In addition, the project will nurture community participation in good hygiene practices through training and community sensitization campaigns.  All trainings, awareness raising and capacity building activities will follow national guidelines on COVID-19 preventive measures, e.g. on physical distancing, to avoid mass gatherings and minimize risks of exposure.

The project is aligned with protection mainstreaming to ensure safety and dignity of affected populations without causing harm. Affected populations and all relevant stakeholders including men, women, boys, girls, elderly and people with disability will be involved in decision making throughout the project activities/cycle. 

Furthermore, the project will be a part of an IOM integrated emergency response program and resilience building, where possible, efforts will be made to integrate IOM health, nutrition, shelter, CCCM and protection activities.

Conflict and environmental shocks have been the primary drivers of humanitarian needs in Somalia, leaving girls and boys out of school. According to the Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), 593,000 people were displaced in Somalia between January and September 2021, of which 420,000 were displaced due to conflict and 98,000 due to drought1. Of the people displaced this year, an estimated 237,200 (40%) are school-aged children. In total, there is about 2.9 million displaced people in Somalia and an estimated 1 million of these are school-aged children.

FCA rapid needs assessment (10/21) highlighted the challenges faced by the assessed schools in baidoa and Dinsoor  which include  lack of accessible and gender friendly structures such as chairs,  desks, classrooms, latrines and handwashing facilities, accompanied by shortage of learning and teaching materials such as books, pens and chalks. Lack of qualified and inadequate number of teachers, especially female teachers as well as teachers who are trained in special education needs to handle children with CWDs and negative cultural norms have contributed to the low enrolment, attendance and retention of girls and CwD in schools. The barriers faced by CwD are not limited to those faced by girls, but their enrolment, retention and movement to education are hindered by additional stigma, discrimination and misconceptions. Lack of adequate fencing of the school compound to promote protection and safety and long distances to school cause safety concerns particularly for girls. EiE actors require capacity to provide quality education to CwD. Caregivers also faced with challenges in covering school fees, uniforms and scholastic materials. Strengthening the involvement of community in school management activities and mainstreaming child protection and child safeguarding mechanisms into education will improve access to education for girls and CwD.
Aligning with the 2022 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan, the proposed initiative aims to restore and maintain access to and retention of crisis-affected school children to safe, protective, inclusive and continuous learning opportunities in Bay region of South West State of Somalia. The project will put a strong emphasis on an integrated approach to education focusing on access, quality of education, protection, child safeguarding, gender equality, conflict sensitivity, and disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the design, approach and activities. 
The proposed project will benefit 7100, crisis-affected children (4,400 children in Baidoa and 2,700 children in Dinsor) with at least 45% of girls. The vulnerable poor host community children (40%) will also be targeted since they are also affected by the crisis and have limited access to quality education. Protection and psychosocial well-being of the affected boys and girls as well as teachers is central to the project. FCA will closely work with Somalia Institute for Special Education Needs and Disability (SISEND), the only disability NGO in Somalia that specializes in special education needs, to provide capacity building to teachers, MoE and other education personnel. 
FCA has excellent capacity to scale up, applying best practices and lessons learned from its EiE experiences in other districts of South West State (Baidoa, El-berde and Hudur) to Dinsoor.. Utilizing FCA integrated and innovative approach based on well-known Finnish education system, FCA will take into account the potential impact of Covid-19 pandemic and develop innovative solutions to ensure uninterrupted access to education by the target children.

The proposed project will be implemented in Baidoa and Dinsoor where there are high number of IDP and are in IPC 3. The implementation will be done in close partnership with GREDO; a local NGO that is currently partnering with FCA on the ECHO funded EiE Projects. The project will also be implemented in close collaboration with MoE of Southwest State.

The combined effects of multiple shocks and food insecurity vulnerabilities are adverse on the most vulnerable groups owing to their inability to meet their food consumption and other basic needs and over-reliance on negative coping strategies.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices. 

Under FSC Objective 2, to protect livelihoods and related food sources, FAO will provide in-kind, technical support and tailored trainings to 112,500 HHs to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security and nutrition threats, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to targeted HHs. In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition.

The planned project activities are;
Activity 1: Community mobilization, identification of 10 water catchments and household that are vulnerable but can provide labour for deepening and expansion of productive facilities. 
Activity 2 Procurement and provision of seeds to agro-pastoralist farmers (12kg sorghum, 10kg cowpea and 10 Kg maize) for 3,500 farmers at least 30% women.
Activity 3 Training of farmers on good agronomic practices including conservation agriculture reaching 10% of the target farmers.
Activity 4: 5,250 agro-pastoralist households have increased access to productive assets through rehabilitation of water catchments.
Activity 5: Desilt community water catchments through Cash for Work to increase water storage by 4,200,000lts seasonally in each pan in respective village. The water catchments will provide water for human and livestock and enable the local population to concentrate on crop production.

The livestock will have enough water for drinking, having enough water available to livestock allows for optimal animal performance and health. High water in-take, and the more an animal drinks, the more the milk production and better animal performance. The availability of milk and meat obtained from the livestock, will mean that the household's income will be better, since the households have substitutes to either trade the livestock or sell the direct consumption outputs such as milk or meat, thus the household will utilise the money obtained from such action in many ways, which will consequently enhance the food security situation of the households. 
Activity 6: Conduct post distribution monitoring in each cycle of CFW payments to beneficiaries and food distribution, where at least 5% of the target beneficiaries will be interviewed.
Activity 7: Conduct crop yield assessments for the planted crop stages.

Cluster Objective 2:  Protect livelihoods and related food sources for 830 000 farmers, pastoralists, agro pastoralist and 163 000 rural IDPs across Somalia through emergency agriculture, livestock, and other livelihoods support. ADA will ensure to  protect  and  restore  livelihoods  related  to  food  and  income  sources at least 3,500 households will be reached.

The planned project activities are;
Activity 1: Community mobilization, identification of 10 water catchments and household that are vulnerable but can provide labour for deepening and expansion of productive facilities. 
Activity 2 Procurement and provision of seeds to agro-pastoralist farmers (12kg sorghum, 10kg cowpea and 10 Kg maize) for 3,500 farmers at least 30% women.
Activity 3 Training of farmers on good agronomic practices including conservation agriculture reaching 10% of the target farmers.
Activity 4: 5,250 agro-pastoralist households have increased access to productive assets through rehabilitation of water catchments.
Activity 5: Desilt community water catchments through Cash for Work to increase water storage by 4,200,000lts seasonally in each pan in respective village. The water catchments will provide water for human and livestock and enable the local population to concentrate on crop production.

The livestock will have enough water for drinking, having enough water available to livestock allows for optimal animal performance and health. High water in-take, and the more an animal drinks, the more the milk production and better animal performance. The availability of milk and meat obtained from the livestock, will mean that the household's income will be better, since the households have substitutes to either trade the livestock or sell the direct consumption outputs such as milk or meat, thus the household will utilise the money obtained from such action in many ways, which will consequently enhance the food security situation of the households. 
Activity 6: Conduct post distribution monitoring in each cycle of CFW payments to beneficiaries and food distribution, where at least 5% of the target beneficiaries will be interviewed.
Activity 7: Conduct crop yield assessments for the planted crop stages.
Activity 8: At least 3,000 animals comprising of goats and cows will be supported in animal interventions including support in treatment.",None,TRUE,Full,Project API + ML,Full,0.75091285,1,0,Manual,TRUE

From October to December 2021, food insecurity is expected to further deteriorate among poor rural, urban, and displaced populations due to the impacts of anticipated, below-average 2021 Deyr (October-December) season rainfall, continued insecurity and other food security related risk factors, including rising food prices and cost of living, declining availability of milk for both consumption and sale, and a likely reduction in agricultural employment opportunities during the forthcoming Deyr season.
The project focuses on the delivery of basic lifesaving and protection/restoration of livelihoods of the target population with a special focus on all locations with FSC prioritized persons in need, including IDPs and host communities that are classified in IPC Phase 3 & 4 in terms of response. 
The project is aimed at improving the ability of vulnerable HHs to meet their basic needs, supports protection and recovery of livelihood assets through life-saving UCT, animal treatment services, provision of locally preferred high quality seeds kits and trainings, and rehabilitation of community productive assets through CFW to support the resilience of vulnerable populations against shocks and prevent them from slipping into acute food insecurity. The proposed project aims to target at least 6,600 HHs (39,600) pastoral, agro-pastoral and IDP HHs in Bay, Banadir, Gedo and Togdheer regions in crisis and emergency with delivery of life saving interventions in line with the strategic objectives of the HRP and FSC response plan.
The project is informed by the centrality of protection and a gender, age and diversity-sensitive approach which is mainstreamed throughout the project cycle. Moreover, the project reflects the principles of COOPI Protection Policy and is built consistently with COOPI Protection SOPs and Protection Mainstreaming guidelines. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. COOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation, the beneficiary women, girls and the disabled will be included in decision making processes and in monitoring so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence.
In summary the following activities will be carried out:
1.	Provide UCT to 3,100 HHs that are faced with severe levels of food insecurity (crisis and emergency) with the aim of improving immediate access to food for 3 months.
2.	Rehabilitation of community productive assets through CFW targeting 1,000 vulnerable HHs.
3.	Provision of locally preferred high quality seed kits, trainings and fuel for irrigation for 500 flood affected female and male headed vulnerable riverine farmers in Bele-Hawa Gedo region.
4.	Provision of locally preferred high quality seeds kit (drought tolerant) and trainings for 1,000 female and male headed vulnerable agro-pastoral farmers in Burhakaba district, Bay region.
5.	Emergency livestock treatment (treatment and deworming) campaigns for animals belonging to 1,000 HHs will be dewormed and treated against endemic &prevalent diseases.

There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices. 

Under FSC Objective 2, to protect livelihoods and related food sources, FAO will provide in-kind, technical support and tailored trainings to 112,500 HHs to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security and nutrition threats, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to targeted HHs. In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition. Trainings shall be delivered alongside input provision to build skills in sustainable use of resources provided, build skills in livelihoods management including harvest, post- harvest management, linking beneficiaries to long- term interventions that provide them opportunities to enhance their livelihoods and skills.",,TRUE,"FAOs drought response aims to immediately increase urgent access to food, water, and basic necessities and protect livelihoods for 61,200  severely drought-affected individuals in south and central Somalia.

Under FSC Objective 2, to protect livelihoods and related food sources, FAO will provide in-kind, technical support and tailored trainings to 112,500 HHs to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security and nutrition threats, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to targeted HHs. In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Some 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance across 74 districts in Somalia in 2021. 
The 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview states that the high humanitarian needs in Somalia are driven by seasonal floods, severe drought conditions, acute water diarrhea/ cholera outbreaks and protracted crises, exacerbated by the COVID-19 outbreak. Drought remains the main driver of WASH needs in Somalia leading to displacement and communal conflict over water points. 
According to the WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) 2020, only 39 per cent of people in rural areas have access to water supply. 39 per cent of vulnerable people in Somalia do not have access to sustained, improved and safe water source for drinking and other domestic uses, while 84 per cent still walk for more than 15 minutes to the nearest water source. Due to these constraints, one in five Somalis do not have enough water per day to cover their basic needs for both drinking and domestic use. 92 per cent of the households don’t have water collection and storage containers further impacting their regular access to water. It is estimated that 1.3 million people in 24 drought hotspot locations hugely depend on water trucking during drought due to frequent breakdown or and dry-up of strategic water sources. This is quite unsustainable.
Access to improved sanitation facilities in Somalia is very low. JMCNA 2021 noted that 57 percent of households do not have access to improved sanitation facilities. Additionally, 23 per cent of people across Somalia still defecate in the open, 49 per cent of which are in rural areas. There are 1,507 IDP sites which still have less than 1 latrine per 50 individuals as per the recommended WASH Cluster minimum standards. 
Over half of all IDPs reportedly still faced challenges in terms of access to soap and hand washing facilities according to JMCNA 2021. Only 53 per cent of households across Somalia practise proper hand washing with soap and water while (39 percent) reported that they wash their hands but without soap and only 45 per cent of households have access to Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) material at home or can access it through their local market. 
According to the HNO 2022, the population in need of WASH services in 2022 includes approximately 1,619,415 IDPs and 4,818,944 vulnerable host communities. It's estimated that 6,058,603 people (38 per cent) in the 'Severe' category lack access to safe water and proper sanitation services and are highly vulnerable to AWD and cholera and around 379,757 people (2 percent) are in extreme condition as they access water directly from rivers and surface bonds, practice open defecation and lack access to soap and other essential hygiene materials and are susceptible to communicable diseases
Women and girls are exposed to protection risks including gender-based violence (GBV) when collecting water from too distant water sources or using unimproved overcrowded sanitation facilities which lack safety and protection features. 
CPD is targeting 24,900 people and will train gender-balanced management committees in order to avoid over reliance on unsustainable means of accessing clean water by rehabilitating strategic reliable water points. Committees will also be established to maintain clean sanitation facilities, as well as scale up hygiene promotion initiatives to help minimize AWD/cholera outbreaks during the rainy seasons. Marginalized groups will be consulted in all project phases including design and implementation and ensuring that the location, distance and access routes to the water points, latrines and distribution sites are accessible to all members of the community, including the disabled.

Project aims to provide live-saving and sustainable WASH assistance to disaster affected displaced (25%) and non- displaced populations(75%). The response targets 109,900 people in severe and extreme WASH needs in order to reduce malnutrition especially among children as result of acute water diarrhea. About 68% of AWD/cholera cases reported between June/May 2021 were <5 children from flood-prone districts whose population depends on unprotected water sources, these districts have also high GAM prevalence rates of >15 per cent. The project will continue to restore access to safe and equitable basic WASH services in targeted locations in a dignified manner. Lack of adequate WASH services to the population is a main cause of spread of Acute Diarrheal Diseases (ADD)/ cholera as well as conflict over water sources and related displaced in distress. 

Access to safe water will be increased through rehabilitation of water sources including 8 boreholes, 10 shallow wells and 15 pipeline extension to reduce distance to water point hence increase protection of women and girls. All water systems will be equipped with distribution infrastructure and hybrid energization systems. Taps stand will be located within a radius of at least 500m to reduce distance and enhance security of women and girls. Project will construct 2 major improved water dams in locations that lack other options. Well heads will be raised at a minimum 0.5m to reduce risk flooding and contamination. Water committees comprising men and women from all community groups including the minority and the marginalized will be trained on management, O&M. Local technicians will be trained and provided with O&M tools to undertake repairs whereas consumers will pay for the technician’s services. For major water supply in urban areas, Private Public Parternship (PPP) management system will be adopted. Where possible NRC will partner with local private investors to establish and manage major water supply systems in a sustainable manner. Project will construct 400 latrines for families reintegrated through the durable solutions. NRC undertakes sanitary surveys periodically to identify contamination risks for timely mitigation. All beneficiaries of latrines will be provided with kettle to promote handwashing and sensitized to use soap for handwashing. Design of infrastructure will take into consideration the needs of special groups in the community including the disabled, old, children to ensure they have equitable access to the services. Life-saving WASH interventions will be implemented in case of sudden disaster to reduce the related mortality and morbidity especially among children. This will be through temporary provision of safe water to 6000 HHs through direct delivery or restricted cash depending on context and market functionality, provision of hygiene kits through voucher (3000 HH), construction of 550 simple design emergency latrines, latrine emptying (450 latrines) and safe fecal sludge disposal and hygiene promotion. Schools and health facilities will be provided with latrines (200 institutional latrines). Latrines will be raised above ground level to reduce the risk of flooding during rains. Women and girls will be involved in identification of sites for facilities to ensure their safety and security is taken into account. Latrines will be gender separated, provided with lockable doors and handwashing equipment. Solar street lights (35 posts) will be provided near water points and latrines to improve the security and safety of women and girls especially in crowded IDP settlements.  The beneficiaries will be provided with adequate information on NRC’s complaints, response and feedback mechanisms. 
",,TRUE,"Emergency WASH assistance to drought and displacement affected communities in Galgaduud Life-saving WASH assistance to the most vulnerable displaced and non-displaced disaster affected populations in Somalia. Project aims to provide live-saving and sustainable WASH assistance to disaster affected displaced (25%) and non- displaced populations(75%). The response targets 109,900 people in severe and extreme WASH needs in order to reduce malnutrition especially among children as result of acute water diarrhea. About 68% of AWD/cholera cases reported between June/May 2021 were <5 children from flood-prone districts whose population depends on unprotected water sources, these districts have also high GAM prevalence rates of >15 per cent. The project will continue to restore access to safe and equitable basic WASH services in targeted locations in a dignified manner. Lack of adequate WASH services to the population is a main cause of spread of Acute Diarrheal Diseases (ADD)/ cholera as well as conflict over water sources and related displaced in distress. 

Access to safe water will be increased through rehabilitation of water sources including 8 boreholes, 10 shallow wells and 15 pipeline extension to reduce distance to water point hence increase protection of women and girls. All water systems will be equipped with distribution infrastructure and hybrid energization systems. Taps stand will be located within a radius of at least 500m to reduce distance and enhance security of women and girls. Project will construct 2 major improved water dams in locations that lack other options. Well heads will be raised at a minimum 0.5m to reduce risk flooding and contamination.

This has led to HH food insecurity, sharp increase in debt levels among poor HHs and poor animal health and produce. 
A delayed and poor Deyr season, worsened drought conditions in the target regions resulting in majority of HHs having inadequate access to food and water while staple food and commodity prices have risen at an average of 8.5% in Gedo and 24% in Bay regions over the past year (COOPI PNA, Oct 2021). From October to December 2021, food insecurity is expected to further deteriorate among poor rural, urban, and displaced populations due to the impacts of anticipated, below-average 2021 Deyr (October-December) season rainfall, continued insecurity and other food security related risk factors, including rising food prices and cost of living, declining availability of milk for both consumption and sale, and a likely reduction in agricultural employment opportunities during the forthcoming Deyr season.
The project focuses on the delivery of basic lifesaving and protection/restoration of livelihoods of the target population with a special focus on all locations with FSC prioritized persons in need, including IDPs and host communities that are classified in IPC Phase 3 & 4 in terms of response. 
The project is aimed at improving the ability of vulnerable HHs to meet their basic needs, supports protection and recovery of livelihood assets through life-saving UCT, animal treatment services, provision of locally preferred high quality seeds kits and trainings, and rehabilitation of community productive assets through CFW to support the resilience of vulnerable populations against shocks and prevent them from slipping into acute food insecurity. The proposed project aims to target at least 6,600 HHs (39,600) pastoral, agro-pastoral and IDP HHs in Bay, Banadir, Gedo and Togdheer regions in crisis and emergency with delivery of life saving interventions in line with the strategic objectives of the HRP and FSC response plan.
The project is informed by the centrality of protection and a gender, age and diversity-sensitive approach which is mainstreamed throughout the project cycle. Moreover, the project reflects the principles of COOPI Protection Policy and is built consistently with COOPI Protection SOPs and Protection Mainstreaming guidelines. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. COOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation, the beneficiary women, girls and the disabled will be included in decision making processes and in monitoring so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence.
In summary the following activities will be carried out:
1.	Provide UCT to 3,100 HHs that are faced with severe levels of food insecurity (crisis and emergency) with the aim of improving immediate access to food for 3 months.
2.	Rehabilitation of community productive assets through CFW targeting 1,000 vulnerable HHs.
3.	Provision of locally preferred high quality seed kits, trainings and fuel for irrigation for 500 flood affected female and male headed vulnerable riverine farmers in Bele-Hawa Gedo region.
4.	Provision of locally preferred high quality seeds kit (drought tolerant) and trainings for 1,000 female and male headed vulnerable agro-pastoral farmers in Burhakaba district, Bay region.
5.	Emergency livestock treatment (treatment and deworming) campaigns for animals belonging to 1,000 HHs will be dewormed and treated against endemic &prevalent diseases.

La persistencia de la crisis económica y política en Venezuela durante los últimos años ha colocado a una parte importante de su población en situación de extrema precariedad. Las interrupciones de las actividades educativas y la cadena de suministro de alimentos locales debido a la pandemia COVID-19, ha afectado profundamente la oportunidad de la población vulnerable, incluidos niños en edad escolar y familias productoras, de acceder a alimentos esenciales y a insumos productivos que fortalezcan su SAN, respectivamente. 
En este sentido, durante el periodo 2020-2021, la cobertura del Programa de Alimentación Escolar (PAE) ha tenido deficiencia en frecuencia, ingesta nutricional y dieta equilibrada para no menos de 4.5 millones de niños y se estima que alrededor de 1.1 millones corren el riego de abandonar la Escuela. Al mismo tiempo, la disminución continua de la producción local de alimentos se agrava por el limitado acceso a insumos agrícolas esenciales -como semillas con calidad- por parte de los pequeños productores, agravando la inseguridad alimentaria y financiera preexistente en las comunidades.
Por lo anterior expuesto, la presente acción tiene como propósito principal el de mejorar la SAN de niños y niñas en edad escolar, además de los hogares rurales en situación de vulnerabilidad, esto, mediante el desarrollo de modelos de Alimentación Escolar basados en la producción local que FAO y UNICEF han pilotado y validad en cuatro estados del país. Complementariamente, la acción promoverá esquemas comunitarios de producción variada de semillas de forma artesanal, adaptadas climáticamente y que respetan la cultura y saberes locales productivos. 
Bajo este objetivo, se propone el desarrollo de los siguientes componentes:
PRODUCTO 1: Fortalecido el modelo de Alimentación Escolar basado en la producción local de la Agricultura Familiar (AF): A través de rehabilitar y/o mejorar las capacidades productivas de las Escuelas Técnicas Agrícolas (ETA) y Asociación Local de Productores (ALP) incrementando su productividad aplicando prácticas agroecológicas para producción de alimentos, huevos y semillas, además desarrollando acciones de asistencia técnica. Se espera que, con la disponibilidad de una producción local de huevos, hortalizas y frutas, se logre fomentar modelos alimentarios de circuito corto, saludables y sostenibles, en donde los niños y niñas de edad escolar en situación de vulnerabilidad - y de manera indirecta el de familias vulnerables de agricultores de pequeña escala - mejoran el consumo de alimentos diversificados, frescos y nutritivos.
PRODUCTO 2: Mejorado el acceso a semillas con calidad, por parte de los pequeños productores familiares locales; a través de una implementación de un modelo de producción de semillas comunitario, sostenibles y resilientes. En este modelo, las ETA jugarán un rol de motor de producción y difusión de conocimiento y los productores a través de las ALP, serán el factor de escalamiento de la capacidad de producción y accesibilidad de la semillas para los demás productores
Para la implementación del proyecto se han priorizado estados con población indígena y, cuando sea posible, se dará la prioridad de participación a agricultoras y agricultores indígenas y a mujeres líderes de hogar, en los estados Amazonas, Sucre, Monagas, Falcon, Zulia, Delta Amacuro, Bolívar y Apure. La acción espera dar cobertura a alrededor de 13 750 hogares de pequeños productores y productoras, aglutinando alrededor de 450 grupos productivos y/o Bancos de Semillas Comunitarios, que contribuyan a la protección y acumulación de sus medios de vida productivos esenciales y en conjunto con 50 ETAs y 25 escuelas de educación básica y primaria, puedan abastecer complementos alimentarios frescos y sanos para alrededor 27 000 niños y niñas en edad escolar.

Complementariamente, la acción promoverá esquemas comunitarios de producción variada de semillas de forma artesanal, adaptadas climáticamente y que respetan la cultura y saberes locales productivos. 
Bajo este objetivo, se propone el desarrollo de los siguientes componentes:
PRODUCTO 1: Fortalecido el modelo de Alimentación Escolar basado en la producción local de la Agricultura Familiar (AF): A través de rehabilitar y/o mejorar las capacidades productivas de las Escuelas Técnicas Agrícolas (ETA) y Asociación Local de Productores (ALP) incrementando su productividad aplicando prácticas agroecológicas para producción de alimentos, huevos y semillas, además desarrollando acciones de asistencia técnica. Se espera que, con la disponibilidad de una producción local de huevos, hortalizas y frutas, se logre fomentar modelos alimentarios de circuito corto, saludables y sostenibles, en donde los niños y niñas de edad escolar en situación de vulnerabilidad - y de manera indirecta el de familias vulnerables de agricultores de pequeña escala - mejoran el consumo de alimentos diversificados, frescos y nutritivos.
PRODUCTO 2: Mejorado el acceso a semillas con calidad, por parte de los pequeños productores familiares locales; a través de una implementación de un modelo de producción de semillas comunitario, sostenibles y resilientes. En este modelo, las ETA jugarán un rol de motor de producción y difusión de conocimiento y los productores a través de las ALP, serán el factor de escalamiento de la capacidad de producción y accesibilidad de la semillas para los demás productores
Para la implementación del proyecto se han priorizado estados con población indígena y, cuando sea posible, se dará la prioridad de participación a agricultoras y agricultores indígenas y a mujeres líderes de hogar, en los estados Amazonas, Sucre, Monagas, Falcon, Zulia, Delta Amacuro, Bolívar y Apure. La acción espera dar cobertura a alrededor de 13 750 hogares de pequeños productores y productoras, aglutinando alrededor de 450 grupos productivos y/o Bancos de Semillas Comunitarios, que contribuyan a la protección y acumulación de sus medios de vida productivos esenciales y en conjunto con 50 ETAs y 25 escuelas de educación básica y primaria, puedan abastecer complementos alimentarios frescos y sanos para alrededor 27 000 niños y niñas en edad escolar.

Cette réponse s’inscrit dans la Stratégie de Prévention et de Gestion des Crises Alimentaires 2021 – 2025 du Dispositif National de Prévention et de Gestion de Crises Alimentaires (DNPGCA). Ce plan s’inscrit aussi dans le Plan d’Action 2021-2023 du Comité Technique Tripartite sur le Nexus Urgence-Développement (CTTNUD), en vue d’une mobilisation des ressources financières pour une planification et une mise en œuvre concertée des activités relatives à la promotion du NEXUS.  Dans le cas spécifique de l’assistance aux retournés dans leurs villages d’origine, qui est envisagée en 2022, la Loi 2018-74, relative à la protection et à l’assistance aux Personnes Déplacées Internes (PDI) cadrera le processus. Rappelons que l’Activité 1, relative aux urgences s’inscrit dans l’effet direct stratégique 1 du CSP (2020-2024) du PAM Niger « Les populations affectées, y compris les réfugiés, les personnes déplacées internes, les communautés hôtes et les retournés dans les zones ciblées sont en mesure de répondre aux besoins alimentaires minimums pendant et après la crise ».

Niger Country Strategic Plan - Food Assistance
(USAID / BHA) Niger Country Strategic Plan La vision de la réponse aux urgences dans le cadre du Plan Stratégique Pays (PSP) 2020-2024 du PAM Niger est la réduction de l’empreinte humanitaire dans la mise en œuvre de l’Activité 1, relative aux urgences du PSP à travers la promotion de l’approche NEXUS. Cette réponse s’inscrit dans la Stratégie de Prévention et de Gestion des Crises Alimentaires 2021 – 2025 du Dispositif National de Prévention et de Gestion de Crises Alimentaires (DNPGCA). Ce plan s’inscrit aussi dans le Plan d’Action 2021-2023 du Comité Technique Tripartite sur le Nexus Urgence-Développement (CTTNUD), en vue d’une mobilisation des ressources financières pour une planification et une mise en œuvre concertée des activités relatives à la promotion du NEXUS.  Dans le cas spécifique de l’assistance aux retournés dans leurs villages d’origine, qui est envisagée en 2022, la Loi 2018-74, relative à la protection et à l’assistance aux Personnes Déplacées Internes (PDI) cadrera le processus. Rappelons que l’Activité 1, relative aux urgences s’inscrit dans l’effet direct stratégique 1 du CSP (2020-2024) du PAM Niger « Les populations affectées, y compris les réfugiés, les personnes déplacées internes, les communautés hôtes et les retournés dans les zones ciblées sont en mesure de répondre aux besoins alimentaires minimums pendant et après la crise ».  La réponse aux urgences du PAM concernant la SECAL, basée sur une approche flexible, concernera toutes les trois (3) composantes de cette réponse en 2022 :
•	Le Mécanisme de Réponse Rapide (RRM)
•	La réponse aux crises prolongées.
•	La réponse à la soudure agricole et pastorale.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices.

In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Es por ello que DRC plantea una respuesta integral no solo a necesidades de  protección como son, el acceso a información, asistencia legal y acceso a documentación para población vulnerable, incluidas las personas sobrevivientes y en riesgo de VbG,  el acceso a asistencia individualizada y especifica de protección y prevención de trata sino también a cubrir necesidades básicas de seguridad alimentaria;  mediante distribuciones mensuales de kits familiares alimenticios por 10 meses en las zonas de intervención, salud; con la rehabilitación de centros médicos seleccionados y educación; proveyendo suministros escolares y de higiene personal y familiar, a través de una intervención multisectorial y previamente coordinada con autoridades y comunidades locales. Uno de los hallazgos de la evaluación de campo fue la falta de data relacionada a protección para poder producir análisis confiables, es por esto por lo que DRC plantea implementar un análisis de protección basado en evidencia a través de un monitoreo continuo de protección en las localidades de intervención, con la finalidad de tener información a tiempo para poder identificar riesgos y priorizar necesidades.

In late 2021, this serious situation has been exacerbated by conflict, forced evictions of IDPs, and ongoing drought. ACTED will save lives and improve the ability of Somali households to meet their basic needs through conditional and unconditional cash transfers to affected households. Through this project, ACTED will address food insecurity through providing unconditional cash transfers based on values from the Somalia Cash Working Group and through providing temporary employment opportunities (cash-for-work) for residents of IDP settlements. Cash-for-work provides an excellent opportunity for efficiently using funds, as funds will provide cash support to families suffering food insecurity while also funding basic improvements to local infrastructure (feeder roads, paths, local market infrastructure, fencing of water points). ACTED’s involvement in this project aims at supporting vulnerable households in Baidoa IDP sites of Bay region, El-Afweyn and Erigavo districts of Sanaag region, through unconditional cash transfers through six months of mobile money transfers. The Consortium will target the most vulnerable households with life-saving multi-purpose unconditional cash transfers. The project will specifically target populations in IPC 3, 4 and 5, especially newly displaced and worst-affected pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities. In addition, this Action seeks to provide life-saving assistance to food insecure communities in the target locations while implementing recovery and resilience activities to restore livelihoods and respond to the needs of IDPs and rural communities in Baidoa, El-Afwayne, Badhan, Diinsoor and Buurhakaba districts. 

Gender and intersecting issues (e.g, disability, pregnancy, age) are key determining factors in how displacement in Somalia is impacting populations across multiple domains. Gender norms relating to men’s and women’s societal roles and responsibilities have resulted in women and girls being disproportionately affected by displacement – and in men representing the majority of victims of intercommunal violence.  Gender is also a key factor in determining IDP’s needs and priorities, and this is particularly notable with regard to SGBV concerns highlighted earlier in this concept note and SHRH and menstrual hygiene concerns. A common challenge that IDP girls and women face is managing menstruation safely and with dignity, and a present lack of access to basic materials such as sanitary pads and underwear can lead to stigmatization (stemming from societal beliefs regarding menstruation) and further associated challenges. Insufficient resources for management of menstrual hygiene can also entail more frequent visits to public sanitation/WASH facilities, increasing risk of SGBV and disease. With regard to institutions and governance, informal governance in Somali IDP sites tends to be male-dominated unless CCCM initiatives have explicitly undertaken gender-mainstreaming interventions to improve community-led site management.

There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices. 

Under FSC Objective 2, to protect livelihoods and related food sources, FAO will provide in-kind, technical support and tailored trainings to 112,500 HHs to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security and nutrition threats, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to targeted HHs. In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

The principle drivers being the deepened armed conflict in many parts of South-Central Somalia and erratic climatic conditions with flooding and drought happening simultaneously in different parts of the Country. 
This coupled with COVID 19 pandemic, not only hampers access to basic services but also leads to increased marginalization of minority groups, displaced persons and persons with special needs, heightened protection risks, loss of livelihoods and income, and limited freedom of movement. In addition, communities have reduced coping capacities and resilience, with women and girls, minority clan members, and people living with disabilities being disproportionately affected. With the country gearing for state and federal elections, there is the likelihood of displacements and disruptions of lives amid intensified attacks from non-state actors. Recent conflicts and violence in mid-2021 displaced 250,000 people in Banaadir, Bardaale and Badweyn, including nearly 207,000 people who were temporally displaced in Mogadishu owing to election-related violence in April 2021. This against a backdrop of limited and constrained humanitarian assistance will not only result in loss of lives, affected livelihoods and destroyed property, but also increased vulnerabilities and heightened protection risks for vulnerable groups.
Data from the PRMN, SPMS and MRM systems designates heightened protection risks in the country with over 4 million people projected to need lifesaving protection assistance (HNO, 2021).  The GBV AOR reported a spike in Intimate Partner Violence, rape, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and abuse against women and girls in 2021 most of which are from displacement affected communities. Furthermore, accruing to the MRM data, Somalia is now the most dangerous conflict on earth for children, where over 23,000 grave violations were recorded in the last 5 year, and of concern is the number of child recruitment and abductions far exceeding any other country in the world. 
Thus, DRC will design and implement interventions targeting the most vulnerable persons in the communities including DACs, girls, women, boys, and men at risk of/ survivors of GBVs, minority groups/clans, persons with disabilities, children and adults affected by armed violence including explosive remnants of wars (ERWs) and other explosive devices, people at risk of forced evictions and most vulnerable host communities to strengthening capacity and the commitment of families and communities to protect communities especially children and women from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, through elimination of harmful practices and all forms of gender-based violence, provision of timely holistic and quality age and gender appropriate services to survivors, persons at risks and vulnerable persons including PSNs in addition to strengthened community-based protection systems.
The proposed interventions thus align with the general protection, GBV, Explosive Hazards (EH) and Housing, Land and Property (HLP) cluster objectives and indicators and the Strategic objectives 1, 2 and 3 of 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan.  The interventions will employ participatory and right based approaches, age, gender and diversity (AGD) approach and community-based child protection approaches which will involve, inclusion of children and caregivers from refugee’s/asylum seeker communities, migrants, IDPs, persons with disability and most vulnerable host communities in addition to local authorities in the project management cycle.

Through this project, Plan International and Partners will effectively provide emergency assistance for food and promote dignity and choices among project participants by increasing purchasing power with short term injection of unconditional cash transfers for 1182 HH (7092 beneficiaries; 3546F, 3546M) for six months. Through field monitoring, government reports, and sector coordination, Plan and Partners will target households in areas identified as IPC3 or worse, risk of drought, and/or IDP communities, including those recently evicted by Somaliland government. These families have insufficient income to cover rising cost of food particularly during periods of drought and other shocks due to COVID19, instability and climate change, and will qualify per criteria, e.g. female headed household, household with person with disability, etc. Partners will ensure the crises affected families receive messages on Infant, Young Child Feeding and Hygiene and have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious foods to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Partners have complementary programs running in these areas to enable consultant and selection within communities. By targeting vulnerable families particularly with children and delivering this intervention in a gender sensitive manner, Plan strives for secondary outcomes of improved the protection environment with reduced risks to women and girls.",None,TRUE,Full,Project API + ML,Full,0.79421085,1,0,Manual,TRUE

Decades of conflict and natural disasters including repeated droughts and seasonal flooding followed by limited government and institutional support have had a profound negative effect on the food security situation and social service sector in Somalia. Nearly seven in ten Somalis live on less than USD 1.90 per day,  the sixth-highest poverty rate in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty is both widespread and deep, particularly for households in rural areas and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements. The number of food-insecure people experiencing long-term stress is trending upwards, indicating that chronic food insecurity persists, requiring sustainable solutions. Recurrent climate-related shocks and political instability are key drivers of food insecurity and pose continuing risks to crop production and food access. Malnutrition in Somalia is driven by a combination of factors such as recurrent food insecurity, child illnesses, high morbidity, micronutrient deficiencies, low immunization levels, poor access to clean water and sanitation, poor hygiene practice, gender inequality and discriminatory sociocultural attitudes leading to poor care practices. Based on the latest Post Gu FSNAU assessment (September 2021), it is estimated that a total of 3.5 million out of the 15.8m people face acute food insecurity (IPC 3 and above – crisis or worse)  until December 2021. At the national level the median prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) has remained at a serious level of 11.1%. Approximately 1.2 million children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished, including 295,515 who are likely to be severely malnourished. In addition to this, around 245,909 Pregnant & Lactating Women (PLWs) will be at risk of acute malnutrition. 

Acute malnutrition is a major public health problem in Somalia. It affects disproportionately children under the age of five, as well as Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLWs), especially among IDPs, vulnerable (agro) pastoralist communities and those living in areas affected by flooding. Morbidity among children is high (≥ 20%). Out of a total of 40 surveyed population groups 18 recorded high morbidity presence of above 20%. 
Vitamin A supplementation and Measles vaccination remains low <40% in several population groups. 

TB prevalence remains one of the highest globally with Somalia in the top 10 countries with high TB burden (262 per 100,000 population) while the HIV prevalence remains <1% however with high stigma and discrimination levels at 94%.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

A medida que Venezuela soporta su octavo año consecutivo de contracción económica agravada por hiperinflación, tensiones políticas, sanciones, aumento de violencia y exposición a desastres naturales, el costo para la sociedad y niños empeora. Los impactos de COVID-19 han intensificado esta situación, dejando a miles de NNAs con necesidades de educación, inmunización, medicamentos, nutrición, agua potable y protección. La mala calidad y cantidad del agua, combinadas con intermitencia, son preocupaciones clave en Venezuela, lo que hace que el lavado de manos, una medida clave de prevención de infecciones, sea extremadamente desafiante.
Entre agosto y septiembre de 2021, el OSPV informó que 65,6% de la población consideraba que el servicio de agua era inadecuado, y solo 27,2% de la población en ciudades tenía suministro regular de agua. Antes de la pandemia, 61% de escuelas carecían de acceso diario a agua potable segura y la ausencia de servicios WASH en ellas fue la causa del ausentismo escolar en 28% de los casos (HNO OCHA, 2019). Con las medidas de contención de la COVID-19, las escuelas estuvieron parcialmente cerradas durante más de 18 meses. La falta de limpieza, desinfección y mantenimiento de los servicios durante el cierre prolongado de las escuelas ha resultado en un mayor deterioro de los servicios de WASH, lo que dificulta la preparación de las escuelas para garantizar un regreso seguro. Las encuestas de UNICEF en 2021 a 127 escuelas públicas en nueve estados muestran que todas las escuelas encuestadas tenían acceso limitado a los servicios WASH. Faltan puntos de lavado de manos adecuados incluso en los establecimientos de salud, donde más se necesitan: el 58% de los 130 establecimientos de salud evaluados en 11 estados no cuentan con instalaciones para el lavado de manos en los puntos de atención donde se trata a los pacientes. Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%. Esto pone a estudiantes, maestros, médicos, enfermeras, pacientes y a toda la población: en riesgo.
Para implementar WASH en instituciones, y comunidades adyacentes, en función del nivel de intervención se incluirán los siguientes elementos para la mejora de los servicios WASH, según la pertinencia y contexto:
•	Diagnóstico participativo de comunidades e instituciones, incluyendo elementos de género, AAP, discapacidad y participación adolescente;
•	Asegurar prácticas de higiene, de limpieza y de tratamiento y conservación del agua a través de actividades con enfoques comunitarios, que incluya la distribución de suministros básicos WASH, de acuerdo con las necesidades específicas de cada institución; así como su adecuado monitoreo y seguimiento;
•	Reparación, rehabilitación y acondicionamiento de instalaciones WASH prioritarias, bajo estándares de calidad, resiliencia, seguridad y sostenibilidad;
•	Formación de comités multidisciplinarios de gestión (instituciones y/o comunitarios), constituidos por personal técnico, administrativo, alumnos/pacientes y lideres comunitarios, para fortalecer capacidades y apoyar la implementación y monitoreo de actividades, bajo estándares de calidad (WASHFIT, WASHSIT, Directrices PCI, 3 estrellas, etc).
•	Distruibuicion de Incentivos, adecuación/dignificación de espacios a personal de mantenimiento y de limpieza, para reforzarla sostenibilidad de las intervenciones;

Adicionalmente, FAO, WFP y UNICEF están comprometidos a implementar programa integral, en escuelas de educación inicial y especial, y las comunidades y los servicios de salud a su alrededor para crear comunidades resilientes, utilizando escuelas como punto central de la comunidad, donde cada organizacion contribuirá en su área de expertise.

Renforcement des capacités étatiques et des services sociaux de base dans les départements cibles pour une meilleure prise en charge des personnes en mobilité et notamment des enfants, y compris des survivant-e-s VBG et des victimes de traite : Un cycle de formation sur la protection des victimes de traite en situation de crise, permettant aussi de vulgariser le mécanisme national de référencement des victimes de traite, sera organisé pour tout acteur de la chaine de protection dans les communes cibles, dont les travailleurs sociaux de la protection de l’enfance et des organisations de la société civile (OSC). Il comprendra également des sessions sur la spécificité de la prise en charge des enfants non accompagnés en contexte humanitaire, et les besoins spécifiques des survivantes de VBG. 
2. Prévention des violences notamment envers les enfants, les femmes et les personnes en situation d'handicap, y compris de survivants de  VBG et diverses exploitations, à travers le renforcement des mécanismes communautaires de protection, l’appui aux leaders communautaires et la mobilisation des filles et garçons : En collaboration avec les DDPFPE, les mairies et les OSC, une cartographie et évaluation des besoins des structures communautaires, y compris les comités de protection, les espaces amis des enfants, les espaces surs et les écoles coraniques accueillant des enfants déplacés, seront réalisées. Suite à cette analyse, l’OIM les appuiera en matériel, afin que ces dernières puissent jouer leur rôle de protection. Leurs compétences seront renforcées afin qu’ils puissent signaler et référer les cas de protection, mais aussi qu’ils développent des actions de prévention qui encouragent des normes et comportements positifs favorisant des communautés respectueuses, égalitaires, et non violentes à l'égard des femmes et des filles. Des appuis aux initiatives des jeunes pour qu’ils sensibilisent leurs pairs seront réalisés. 
3. Atténuation des risques de protection dans les zones ciblées : En vue de prévenir l’adoption de stratégies de survie négatives des populations et de promouvoir leur dignité, l’OIM poursuivra la distribution des kits de protection adaptés aux besoins,  identifiés avec les populations. Enfin, l'organisation continuera le renforcement de la sécurité sur les sites d'intervention de l'équipe Abris et BNA & WASH afin de contribuer à la réduction des risques de protection. 
4. Offre de services de soutien psychosocial et de santé mentale (SMSPS) aux personnes déplacées, notamment les enfants, aux survivants de VBG et aux communautés hôtes : La stratégie de services de SMSPS de l’OIM est basée sur son expertise acquise auprès des migrants vulnérables et conformément aux principes développés par le « manuel de santé mentale et soutien psychosocial communautaire en situations d’urgence et de déplacement » (OIM, 2021). Des activités de sensibilisation et de formations des leaders communautaires et d’agents de santé sont organisées au préalable. Des équipes mobiles composées notamment d’un-e travailleur-se social-e, d’un-e infirmier-ère, d’un-e pyschologue, d’un-e mobilisateur-trice communautaire, se déplaceront pour offrir des activités psychosociales aux populations hôtes et déplacées, notamment là où les structures communautaires sont inexistantes.

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar.
3. Rehabilitación de cocinas escolares para garantizar condiciones adecuadas de preparación de alimentos.
4. Comunicación para sensibilizar acerca de los principios humanitarios, la adecuada preparación de alimentos, nutrición, higiene y mantenimiento de cocinas escolares.
5. Fortalecimiento de capacidades de socios implementadores y personal escolar.
6. Acciones sensibles a la nutrición, que incluyen, tamizaje en las escuelas, educación nutricional, referencia a servicios especializados y entrega de alimento complementario fortificado (Super Cereal Plus).",None,FALSE,Full,Project API + ML,Full,0.59927094,1,0,Manual,FALSE

A medida que Venezuela soporta su octavo año consecutivo de contracción económica agravada por hiperinflación, tensiones políticas, sanciones, aumento de violencia y exposición a desastres naturales, el costo para la sociedad y niños empeora. Los impactos de COVID-19 han intensificado esta situación, dejando a miles de NNAs con necesidades de educación, inmunización, medicamentos, nutrición, agua potable y protección. La mala calidad y cantidad del agua, combinadas con intermitencia, son preocupaciones clave en Venezuela, lo que hace que el lavado de manos, una medida clave de prevención de infecciones, sea extremadamente desafiante.
Entre agosto y septiembre de 2021, el OSPV informó que 65,6% de la población consideraba que el servicio de agua era inadecuado, y solo 27,2% de la población en ciudades tenía suministro regular de agua. Antes de la pandemia, 61% de escuelas carecían de acceso diario a agua potable segura y la ausencia de servicios WASH en ellas fue la causa del ausentismo escolar en 28% de los casos (HNO OCHA, 2019). Con las medidas de contención de la COVID-19, las escuelas estuvieron parcialmente cerradas durante más de 18 meses. La falta de limpieza, desinfección y mantenimiento de los servicios durante el cierre prolongado de las escuelas ha resultado en un mayor deterioro de los servicios de WASH, lo que dificulta la preparación de las escuelas para garantizar un regreso seguro. Las encuestas de UNICEF en 2021 a 127 escuelas públicas en nueve estados muestran que todas las escuelas encuestadas tenían acceso limitado a los servicios WASH. Faltan puntos de lavado de manos adecuados incluso en los establecimientos de salud, donde más se necesitan: el 58% de los 130 establecimientos de salud evaluados en 11 estados no cuentan con instalaciones para el lavado de manos en los puntos de atención donde se trata a los pacientes. Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%. Esto pone a estudiantes, maestros, médicos, enfermeras, pacientes y a toda la población: en riesgo.
Para implementar WASH en instituciones, y comunidades adyacentes, en función del nivel de intervención se incluirán los siguientes elementos para la mejora de los servicios WASH, según la pertinencia y contexto:
•	Diagnóstico participativo de comunidades e instituciones, incluyendo elementos de género, AAP, discapacidad y participación adolescente;

--- 2022 ---- WASH Mejora del acceso de la población vulnerable a servicios básicos de WASH en Comunidades, Escuelas, Establecimientos de Salud y Atención Nutricional y Espacios de Protección. A medida que Venezuela soporta su octavo año consecutivo de contracción económica agravada por hiperinflación, tensiones políticas, sanciones, aumento de violencia y exposición a desastres naturales, el costo para la sociedad y niños empeora. Los impactos de COVID-19 han intensificado esta situación, dejando a miles de NNAs con necesidades de educación, inmunización, medicamentos, nutrición, agua potable y protección. La mala calidad y cantidad del agua, combinadas con intermitencia, son preocupaciones clave en Venezuela, lo que hace que el lavado de manos, una medida clave de prevención de infecciones, sea extremadamente desafiante.
Entre agosto y septiembre de 2021, el OSPV informó que 65,6% de la población consideraba que el servicio de agua era inadecuado, y solo 27,2% de la población en ciudades tenía suministro regular de agua. Antes de la pandemia, 61% de escuelas carecían de acceso diario a agua potable segura y la ausencia de servicios WASH en ellas fue la causa del ausentismo escolar en 28% de los casos (HNO OCHA, 2019). Con las medidas de contención de la COVID-19, las escuelas estuvieron parcialmente cerradas durante más de 18 meses. La falta de limpieza, desinfección y mantenimiento de los servicios durante el cierre prolongado de las escuelas ha resultado en un mayor deterioro de los servicios de WASH, lo que dificulta la preparación de las escuelas para garantizar un regreso seguro. Las encuestas de UNICEF en 2021 a 127 escuelas públicas en nueve estados muestran que todas las escuelas encuestadas tenían acceso limitado a los servicios WASH. Faltan puntos de lavado de manos adecuados incluso en los establecimientos de salud, donde más se necesitan: el 58% de los 130 establecimientos de salud evaluados en 11 estados no cuentan con instalaciones para el lavado de manos en los puntos de atención donde se trata a los pacientes. Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%. Esto pone a estudiantes, maestros, médicos, enfermeras, pacientes y a toda la población: en riesgo.
Para implementar WASH en instituciones, y comunidades adyacentes, en función del nivel de intervención se incluirán los siguientes elementos para la mejora de los servicios WASH, según la pertinencia y contexto:
•	Diagnóstico participativo de comunidades e instituciones, incluyendo elementos de género, AAP, discapacidad y participación adolescente;
•	Asegurar prácticas de higiene, de limpieza y de tratamiento y conservación del agua a través de actividades con enfoques comunitarios, que incluya la distribución de suministros básicos WASH, de acuerdo con las necesidades específicas de cada institución; así como su adecuado monitoreo y seguimiento;
•	Reparación, rehabilitación y acondicionamiento de instalaciones WASH prioritarias, bajo estándares de calidad, resiliencia, seguridad y sostenibilidad;
•	Formación de comités multidisciplinarios de gestión (instituciones y/o comunitarios), constituidos por personal técnico, administrativo, alumnos/pacientes y lideres comunitarios, para fortalecer capacidades y apoyar la implementación y monitoreo de actividades, bajo estándares de calidad (WASHFIT, WASHSIT, Directrices PCI, 3 estrellas, etc).

Los principales servicios brindados incluyen: apoyo en acceder a registro de nacimiento, salud mental y apoyo psicosocial, gestión de caso incluyendo a NNA sobreviviente de VbG. Una modalidad diferente para alcanzar objetivos de protección será la de las transferencias monetarias/incentivos, otra componente importante de todas las intervenciones es el enfoque en la calidad y en temas transversales como lo de género, AAP, PEAS, adolescencia y inclusión.

Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%.

Decades of conflict and natural disasters including repeated droughts and seasonal flooding followed by limited government and institutional support have had a profound negative effect on the food security situation and social service sector in Somalia. Nearly seven in ten Somalis live on less than USD 1.90 per day,  the sixth-highest poverty rate in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty is both widespread and deep, particularly for households in rural areas and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements. The number of food-insecure people experiencing long-term stress is trending upwards, indicating that chronic food insecurity persists, requiring sustainable solutions. Recurrent climate-related shocks and political instability are key drivers of food insecurity and pose continuing risks to crop production and food access. Malnutrition in Somalia is driven by a combination of factors such as recurrent food insecurity, child illnesses, high morbidity, micronutrient deficiencies, low immunization levels, poor access to clean water and sanitation, poor hygiene practice, gender inequality and discriminatory sociocultural attitudes leading to poor care practices. Based on the latest Post Gu FSNAU assessment (September 2021), it is estimated that a total of 3.5 million out of the 15.8m people face acute food insecurity (IPC 3 and above – crisis or worse)  until December 2021. At the national level the median prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) has remained at a serious level of 11.1%. Approximately 1.2 million children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished, including 295,515 who are likely to be severely malnourished. In addition to this, around 245,909 Pregnant & Lactating Women (PLWs) will be at risk of acute malnutrition. 

Acute malnutrition is a major public health problem in Somalia. It affects disproportionately children under the age of five, as well as Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLWs), especially among IDPs, vulnerable (agro) pastoralist communities and those living in areas affected by flooding. Morbidity among children is high (≥ 20%). Out of a total of 40 surveyed population groups 18 recorded high morbidity presence of above 20%. 
Vitamin A supplementation and Measles vaccination remains low <40% in several population groups. 

TB prevalence remains one of the highest globally with Somalia in the top 10 countries with high TB burden (262 per 100,000 population) while the HIV prevalence remains <1% however with high stigma and discrimination levels at 94%.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Cette assistance concernera l'accès à l'eau potable, la promotion des latrines et la sensibilisation sur l'hygiène et la Covid-19,  tout en garantissant la protection des plus vulnérables.
Ainsi, notre action dans le sous-secteur de l'eau visera à :

Pour l'assainissement:
Vu que les latrines d’urgence ne rencontrent pas l’assentiment des bénéficiaires, GOAL se propose d'initier un dialogue communautaire autour de la défécation a l’aire libre et convenir d’un plan d’action basé sur le renforcement du système en faveur des latrines améliorées au niveau des sites et des communautés hôtes. Ceci tournera notamment autour de la mise en place de kits d’EHA classiques, d'un réseau de maçons privés et de structures communautaires d’EHA pour encourager la bonne pratique, une stratégie favorisant la demande des latrines et la gestion des déchets solides.
 Pour susciter davantage la demande, des concours inter quartiers d'hygiène et assainissement seront lancés sur chaque sites avec l'adhésion des bénéficiaires. les critères établis par les bénéficiaires, seront évalués par des jurys locaux et les lauréats récompensés par des kits WASH. Nous envisageons de former une vingtaine de maçons privés, équipés pour la construction des latrines améliorées dans les 4 localités. Ces maçons seront utilisés pour la construction de 500 latrines familiales améliorées principalement à Mangaizé, mais également sur les autres sites.
1 000 kits NFI WASH constitués de 2 bidons, 1 seau, 15 savons et 3 serviettes hygiéniques seront également partagés aux bénéficiaires. 48 relais communautaires seront formés pour la promotion de l'hygiène sur les 4 sites.

- promouvoir la purification de l'eau dans les 4 localités à travers un appui à la vulgarisation des purifiants par des opérateurs économiques privés. l'objectif étant de disposer d'au moins un revendeur de purifiants d'eau dans chacune des localités.
Pour l'assainissement:
Vu que les latrines d’urgence ne rencontrent pas l’assentiment des bénéficiaires, GOAL se propose d'initier un dialogue communautaire autour de la défécation a l’aire libre et convenir d’un plan d’action basé sur le renforcement du système en faveur des latrines améliorées au niveau des sites et des communautés hôtes. Ceci tournera notamment autour de la mise en place de kits d’EHA classiques, d'un réseau de maçons privés et de structures communautaires d’EHA pour encourager la bonne pratique, une stratégie favorisant la demande des latrines et la gestion des déchets solides.
 Pour susciter davantage la demande, des concours inter quartiers d'hygiène et assainissement seront lancés sur chaque sites avec l'adhésion des bénéficiaires. les critères établis par les bénéficiaires, seront évalués par des jurys locaux et les lauréats récompensés par des kits WASH. Nous envisageons de former une vingtaine de maçons privés, équipés pour la construction des latrines améliorées dans les 4 localités. Ces maçons seront utilisés pour la construction de 500 latrines familiales améliorées principalement à Mangaizé, mais également sur les autres sites.
1 000 kits NFI WASH constitués de 2 bidons, 1 seau, 15 savons et 3 serviettes hygiéniques seront également partagés aux bénéficiaires. 48 relais communautaires seront formés pour la promotion de l'hygiène sur les 4 sites.
Enfin, une campagne de sensibilisation radiophonique sera entreprise à travers les 2 radios communautaires de Ouallam et Tondikiwindi, sur les thématiques de l'hygiène assainissement et de la COVID-19.",None,FALSE,Full,Project API + ML,Full,0.5915076,1,0,Manual,FALSE

This includes both IDPs and non-IDPs and remains a concern for 58% of the entire IDP population in Somalia. Key concerns under shelter include overcrowding, lack of security, and poor shelter conditions with majority of those living in IDP sites lacking permanent tenure to land thus increasing their risk for forced evictions. Lack of access to income is also a key concern for the most vulnerable as they often lack the necessary finances to put up adequate shelters thus necessitating the need to provide emergency shelter and non-food items. This remains particularly crucial especially in hard to reach areas of Somalia. 
The ongoing conflict and floods in parts of Somalia has resulted in damages to shelter among other critical infrastructure, and with the resulting displacement, populations often find themselves living in dangerous and unsustainable shelters. Those that are displaced for a shorter period with the intention and capability of returning to regions of origin often need emergency shelter kits while those that have been displaced for a longer period of time would require more durable shelters.

On the other hand, DRC targets Host Communities – to ensure peaceful coexistence between the local population and target groups and also because many of them are equally vulnerable and in need of humanitarian assistance.

Este programa inició en 2021 con comidas escolares en emergencias priorizando escuelas iniciales y de educación especial.

WFP proporciona comidas escolares acompañado de un paquete integrado de intervenciones para mejorar el acceso a alimentos nutritivos y diversificados a través de las escuelas, contribuyendo al mismo tiempo a mejorar la salud y la nutrición de los niños en edad escolar, los estudiantes con discapacidad y el personal escolar, y apoyando a las comunidades a reducir la dependencia en estrategias de afrontamiento. De manera gradual, el WFP está realizando compras locales de alimentos, e incluyendo acciones para apoyar los mercados locales con compras a pequeños productores y apoyo técnico para acceso a mercados.

En este sentido, el programa de comidas escolares en emergencias tiene los siguientes componentes, para asegurar un enfoque integral que apoye al estudiante en el entorno escolar y familiar:

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar.
3. Rehabilitación de cocinas escolares para garantizar condiciones adecuadas de preparación de alimentos.
4. Comunicación para sensibilizar acerca de los principios humanitarios, la adecuada preparación de alimentos, nutrición, higiene y mantenimiento de cocinas escolares.

Este programa inició en 2021 con comidas escolares en emergencias priorizando escuelas iniciales y de educación especial.

WFP proporciona comidas escolares acompañado de un paquete integrado de intervenciones para mejorar el acceso a alimentos nutritivos y diversificados a través de las escuelas, contribuyendo al mismo tiempo a mejorar la salud y la nutrición de los niños en edad escolar, los estudiantes con discapacidad y el personal escolar, y apoyando a las comunidades a reducir la dependencia en estrategias de afrontamiento. De manera gradual, el WFP está realizando compras locales de alimentos, e incluyendo acciones para apoyar los mercados locales con compras a pequeños productores y apoyo técnico para acceso a mercados.

En este sentido, el programa de comidas escolares en emergencias tiene los siguientes componentes, para asegurar un enfoque integral que apoye al estudiante en el entorno escolar y familiar:

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar.
3. Rehabilitación de cocinas escolares para garantizar condiciones adecuadas de preparación de alimentos.
4. Comunicación para sensibilizar acerca de los principios humanitarios, la adecuada preparación de alimentos, nutrición, higiene y mantenimiento de cocinas escolares.
5. Fortalecimiento de capacidades de socios implementadores y personal escolar.

La persistencia de la crisis económica y política en Venezuela durante los últimos años ha colocado a una parte importante de su población en situación de extrema precariedad. Las interrupciones de las actividades educativas y la cadena de suministro de alimentos locales debido a la pandemia COVID-19, ha afectado profundamente la oportunidad de la población vulnerable, incluidos niños en edad escolar y familias productoras, de acceder a alimentos esenciales y a insumos productivos que fortalezcan su SAN, respectivamente. 
En este sentido, durante el periodo 2020-2021, la cobertura del Programa de Alimentación Escolar (PAE) ha tenido deficiencia en frecuencia, ingesta nutricional y dieta equilibrada para no menos de 4.5 millones de niños y se estima que alrededor de 1.1 millones corren el riego de abandonar la Escuela. Al mismo tiempo, la disminución continua de la producción local de alimentos se agrava por el limitado acceso a insumos agrícolas esenciales -como semillas con calidad- por parte de los pequeños productores, agravando la inseguridad alimentaria y financiera preexistente en las comunidades.
Por lo anterior expuesto, la presente acción tiene como propósito principal el de mejorar la SAN de niños y niñas en edad escolar, además de los hogares rurales en situación de vulnerabilidad, esto, mediante el desarrollo de modelos de Alimentación Escolar basados en la producción local que FAO y UNICEF han pilotado y validad en cuatro estados del país. Complementariamente, la acción promoverá esquemas comunitarios de producción variada de semillas de forma artesanal, adaptadas climáticamente y que respetan la cultura y saberes locales productivos. 
Bajo este objetivo, se propone el desarrollo de los siguientes componentes:
PRODUCTO 1: Fortalecido el modelo de Alimentación Escolar basado en la producción local de la Agricultura Familiar (AF): A través de rehabilitar y/o mejorar las capacidades productivas de las Escuelas Técnicas Agrícolas (ETA) y Asociación Local de Productores (ALP) incrementando su productividad aplicando prácticas agroecológicas para producción de alimentos, huevos y semillas, además desarrollando acciones de asistencia técnica. Se espera que, con la disponibilidad de una producción local de huevos, hortalizas y frutas, se logre fomentar modelos alimentarios de circuito corto, saludables y sostenibles, en donde los niños y niñas de edad escolar en situación de vulnerabilidad - y de manera indirecta el de familias vulnerables de agricultores de pequeña escala - mejoran el consumo de alimentos diversificados, frescos y nutritivos.
PRODUCTO 2: Mejorado el acceso a semillas con calidad, por parte de los pequeños productores familiares locales; a través de una implementación de un modelo de producción de semillas comunitario, sostenibles y resilientes. En este modelo, las ETA jugarán un rol de motor de producción y difusión de conocimiento y los productores a través de las ALP, serán el factor de escalamiento de la capacidad de producción y accesibilidad de la semillas para los demás productores
Para la implementación del proyecto se han priorizado estados con población indígena y, cuando sea posible, se dará la prioridad de participación a agricultoras y agricultores indígenas y a mujeres líderes de hogar, en los estados Amazonas, Sucre, Monagas, Falcon, Zulia, Delta Amacuro, Bolívar y Apure. La acción espera dar cobertura a alrededor de 13 750 hogares de pequeños productores y productoras, aglutinando alrededor de 450 grupos productivos y/o Bancos de Semillas Comunitarios, que contribuyan a la protección y acumulación de sus medios de vida productivos esenciales y en conjunto con 50 ETAs y 25 escuelas de educación básica y primaria, puedan abastecer complementos alimentarios frescos y sanos para alrededor 27 000 niños y niñas en edad escolar.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Este programa inició en 2021 con comidas escolares en emergencias priorizando escuelas iniciales y de educación especial.

WFP proporciona comidas escolares acompañado de un paquete integrado de intervenciones para mejorar el acceso a alimentos nutritivos y diversificados a través de las escuelas, contribuyendo al mismo tiempo a mejorar la salud y la nutrición de los niños en edad escolar, los estudiantes con discapacidad y el personal escolar, y apoyando a las comunidades a reducir la dependencia en estrategias de afrontamiento. De manera gradual, el WFP está realizando compras locales de alimentos, e incluyendo acciones para apoyar los mercados locales con compras a pequeños productores y apoyo técnico para acceso a mercados.

En este sentido, el programa de comidas escolares en emergencias tiene los siguientes componentes, para asegurar un enfoque integral que apoye al estudiante en el entorno escolar y familiar:

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar.
3. Rehabilitación de cocinas escolares para garantizar condiciones adecuadas de preparación de alimentos.
4. Comunicación para sensibilizar acerca de los principios humanitarios, la adecuada preparación de alimentos, nutrición, higiene y mantenimiento de cocinas escolares.
5. Fortalecimiento de capacidades de socios implementadores y personal escolar.
6. Acciones sensibles a la nutrición, que incluyen, tamizaje en las escuelas, educación nutricional, referencia a servicios especializados y entrega de alimento complementario fortificado (Super Cereal Plus).",,TRUE,"Food Assistance Programme Programa de seguridad alimentaria basado en la escuela Con el objetivo de contribuir a la seguridad alimentaria de la población con mayores necesidades, el Programa Mundial de Alimentos de Naciones Unidas (WFP, por sus siglas en inglés) en Venezuela desarrolla un programa de asistencia humanitaria basado en la escuela para garantizar el acceso de los más vulnerables a una alimentación adecuada y nutritiva en el entorno escolar, familiar y comunitario.

Este programa inició en 2021 con comidas escolares en emergencias priorizando escuelas iniciales y de educación especial.

WFP proporciona comidas escolares acompañado de un paquete integrado de intervenciones para mejorar el acceso a alimentos nutritivos y diversificados a través de las escuelas, contribuyendo al mismo tiempo a mejorar la salud y la nutrición de los niños en edad escolar, los estudiantes con discapacidad y el personal escolar, y apoyando a las comunidades a reducir la dependencia en estrategias de afrontamiento. De manera gradual, el WFP está realizando compras locales de alimentos, e incluyendo acciones para apoyar los mercados locales con compras a pequeños productores y apoyo técnico para acceso a mercados.

En este sentido, el programa de comidas escolares en emergencias tiene los siguientes componentes, para asegurar un enfoque integral que apoye al estudiante en el entorno escolar y familiar:

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar a través de comida en especie o transferencias monetarias.

La alianza con la autoridad nacional de protección de la niñez CONAPINA, y las unidades dedicadas de la Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) y la Procuraduría para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (PDDH), del Ministerio de Educación, Ciencia y Tecnología (MINEDUCYT), sustentarán y reforzarán acciones para la protección de la niñez desplazada por la fuerza.

ACNUR apoyará a las instituciones con recursos humanos para poder atender a niños, niñas y adolescentes que se encuentran desplazados o en riesgo de desplazamiento, buscando protección como refugiados y retornados con necesidades de protección.  Específicamente, ACNUR apoyará con profesionales de psicología que brindarán atención en los puntos de recepción, aeropuertos y fronteras; además de en comunidades donde había alto riesgo de violencia de pandillas en las que se implementarán espacios amigables para niños, niñas y adolescentes. Además, ACNUR fortalecerá capacidades y apoyará la adecuación de espacios para buscar soluciones para niños, niñas y adolescentes en situación de desplazamiento forzado.

ACNUR cooperará en apoyo a las comunidades históricamente afectadas por la violencia donde el Gobierno impulsará las respuestas a la niñez desplazada o en riesgo que requieren servicios básicos como educación y salud mental. ACNUR dará prioridad al trabajo en cinco comunidades para dar seguimiento a la situación de niñas, niños y adolescentes en mayor riesgo, trabajando con socios y el Gobierno en la identificación de casos y necesidades, y en la provisión de respuestas de protección.

Teniendo en cuenta los avances actuales en el entorno de seguridad, ACNUR impulsará soluciones a través de intervenciones dirigidas a la participación, el retorno a la educación y el bienestar de los niños, niñas y adolescentes. ACNUR adaptará espacios colectivos en cinco comunidades históricamente bajo control de pandillas como espacios amigables de estudio. Estas instalaciones contarán con una persona profesional en psicología y una persona promotora educativa. Trabajando juntos, ayudarán a los niños a recuperar las habilidades sociales y la autoestima afectadas por la violencia y las limitaciones de movilidad causadas por fronteras invisibles. Se guiará a niños, niñas y adolescentes en un proceso de reflexión y resiliencia. La persona promotora brindará apoyo para el retorno al sistema educativo en caso de deserción en coordinación con el Ministerio de Educación, Ciencia y Tecnología.

Estas afectaciones incrementan situaciones de desigualdad, pobreza y de violencia, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG) y vulneración de los derechos de los niños, niñas y adolescentes, así como a grupos especialmente marginalizados como la población LGBTIQ+, indígena, en condición de discapacidad, generando desplazamiento al interior del país y hacia los países del norte del continente.

Por un lado, la situación de violencia e inseguridad sigue impactando a miles de personas, evidenciado en el indicador de muertes violentas el cual registró un incremento de 6,7 por ciento con respecto al año anterior, llegando a una tasa de 17.3 por cada 100 mil habitantes, una de las más altas en Centro América. Los principales delitos denunciados son extorsión, hurto, robo, homicidios, lesiones, violencia sexual a NNA y mujeres adultas. A pesar de la mejora en ciertos indicadores de seguridad en el país, el alcance, control y violencia ejercida por grupos de delincuencia organizada continúa planteando serios desafíos a la protección de la población. Las pandillas poseen un amplio control en el país y están vinculadas a delitos violentos, extorsión, reclutamiento forzado y actividades relacionadas con el tráfico de drogas. Adicionalmente, las elecciones presidenciales y una transición política alterada, ha generado que los lideres indígenas se movilicen en protestas, generando varios bloqueos paralizando las principales rutas del país.  
Adicionalmente, las consecuencias del cambio climático en el área del corredor seco están provocando una crisis de inseguridad alimentaria, con cerca de 4.9 millones de personas afectadas, según el análisis del CIF (Clasificación Integrada en Fases) para el periodo junio/septiembre 2022; lo que representa un 25% del total de la población. Estas afectaciones incrementan situaciones de desigualdad, pobreza y de violencia, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG) y vulneración de los derechos de los niños, niñas y adolescentes, así como a grupos especialmente marginalizados como la población LGBTIQ+, indígena, en condición de discapacidad, generando desplazamiento al interior del país y hacia los países del norte del continente. 

Se estima, por lo tanto, que hay más de 2.9 millones de personas con necesidades de protección en Guatemala. Aproximadamente 41% de las personas con necesidades son mujeres adultas y un 40% NNA. Hasta diciembre de 2024, el clúster de protección proyecta cubrir las necesidades de al menos 810.000 personas. 

A esto se suma, que durante 2023 se generó un aumento del número de personas en movilidad humana (personas solicitantes de la condición de refugiado y refugiados, retornadas, desplazadas y migrantes en tránsito) que atraviesan el país. Según el Servicio Nacional de Migración de Panamá más de 400,000 personas habían cruzado el Darién en septiembre 2023, con la cifra más alta registrada en agosto 2023 de 82,000 personas. Los anuncios y cambios en la política migratoria regional de los EE. UU, han generado incertidumbre frente al futuro inmediato de las personas en Movilidad Humana y reflejan los desafíos institucionales que tiene el país para asegurar una respuesta adecuada y acceso a medidas de protección frente a la agudización de las necesidades humanitarias y recrudecimiento de las condiciones en la ruta (extorsiones, robos, violencia sexual).

El proyecto basado en Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición, se llevará a cabo en las tres zonas del país (Occidente, Centro y Oriente). El enfoque principal es promover la seguridad alimentaria en familias priorizadas con miembros (adultos y niñez) con algún tipo de discapacidad. Cabe destacar que, de acuerdo al Consejo Nacional de Inclusión de Personas con Discapacidad (CONAIPD), para el 2015 el porcentaje de discapacidad oscilaba al 6.4 % de la población total del país, siendo este porcentaje, un equivalente a 410,798 personas bajo este grupo vulnerable, teniendo una mayor prevalencia en los sectores urbanos y peri-urbanos. La meta propuesta o alcance poblacional de la propuesta, es llegar un total de 32K personas (8K familias) bajo tres resultados: 
 1) Familias capacitadas en temas que les permita mejorar o recuperar sus medios de vida posterior a la 
     múltiple amenaza.
 2) Familias que reciben apoyo monetario mediante programas de transferencias multipropósito y sin 
     condición con enfoque de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición en Emergencias. 
 3) Familias sensibilizadas mediante la difusión de información clave para la adopción de buenos hábitos

El enfoque principal es promover la seguridad alimentaria en familias priorizadas con miembros (adultos y niñez) con algún tipo de discapacidad. Cabe destacar que, de acuerdo al Consejo Nacional de Inclusión de Personas con Discapacidad (CONAIPD), para el 2015 el porcentaje de discapacidad oscilaba al 6.4 % de la población total del país, siendo este porcentaje, un equivalente a 410,798 personas bajo este grupo vulnerable, teniendo una mayor prevalencia en los sectores urbanos y peri-urbanos. La meta propuesta o alcance poblacional de la propuesta, es llegar un total de 32K personas (8K familias) bajo tres resultados: 
 1) Familias capacitadas en temas que les permita mejorar o recuperar sus medios de vida posterior a la 
     múltiple amenaza.
 2) Familias que reciben apoyo monetario mediante programas de transferencias multipropósito y sin

Los factores que subyacen a la movilidad humana en El Salvador son diversos y complejos e incluyen, entre otros: desigualdad social, brechas de acceso a servicios básicos, violencia en sus diversas formas y ámbitos, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG), limitado acceso a empleo formal y oportunidades económicas, y pretensiones de reunificación familiar. 
Los desastres naturales y de origen humano, exacerbados por el cambio climático, agravan los factores subyacentes a la movilidad. 
La violencia basada en género también motiva a las niñas, adolescentes y mujeres a huir y recurrir al desplazamiento interno y a la migración en condición irregular como medidas de afrontamiento, que ponen en riesgo su vida y seguridad en tránsito y destino.

La violencia generalizada que sufren los niños, niñas y adolescentes en sus hogares, comunidades o escuelas, siguen siendo un detonante para el desplazamiento y la migración.

Se prevé que la sequía tenga graves repercusiones en los medios de subsistencia y la seguridad alimentaria de los hogares de las zonas más afectadas. Estos impactos pueden llevar a las personas a adoptar estrategias negativas para hacer frente a la situación, como el trabajo infantil, la discriminación en el reparto de alimentos dentro de la familia y el matrimonio precoz, entre otras.

Ello orientado al fortalecimiento de su resiliencia, la reintegración en sus comunidades y la plena restitución de sus derechos.

UNICEF will contribute to the inter-agency humanitarian response in 2024 and will also complement UNICEF's development work under its 2023-2026 country programme.

Objective: UNICEF is committed to continuing to focus on critical unmet needs and remaining inequalities related to maternal, neonatal and under-five child survival.

Project Description: The project focuses on improving access and quality of basic services to address the multiple health deprivations faced by children, adolescents and pregnant women. UNICEF's response incorporates a child-centred approach and is built around community settings, including health centers and surrounding communities. Priority will be given to supporting health systems that reliably provide integrated service packages for children, adolescents and women, focusing on health, nutrition and WASH, also facilitating child protection services and linked to social protection and social well-being initiatives, as well as as well as the educational sector. , particularly for health promotion and prevention, improving health literacy, screening and promoting early childhood development and the mental health and well-being of children and their caregivers.

Strategies and implementation: UNICEF will promote three approaches to achieve the goals:
1. Address inequalities in health outcomes;
2. Strengthen health systems, including emergency preparedness, response and resilience; and
3. Promotion of integrated and multisectoral policies and programs.

The strategy also includes:
Strengthen service delivery, empower communities for health promotion, prevention and social behavior change, build capacity of health service providers, strengthen supply chain systems (essential products and equipment ), generate demand and strengthen accountability.

Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness of the project, UNICEF will implement a robust monitoring and evaluation system. This will involve periodic monitoring of health interventions, evaluations of health professionals after training and monitoring of the distribution and use of supplies, as well as evaluation of the quality of case management based on compliance with standardized protocols and regulations.

These actions will be implemented in selected urban, peri-urban and remote rural areas of 10 nationally prioritized states, with the exception of HIV interventions and immunization coverage is national, and will reach 750,303 people, including 559,291 children and 125,000 pregnant women .",,,"HAC-VENEZUELA

Con las medidas de contención de la COVID-19, las escuelas estuvieron parcialmente cerradas durante más de 18 meses. La falta de limpieza, desinfección y mantenimiento de los servicios durante el cierre prolongado de las escuelas ha resultado en un mayor deterioro de los servicios de WASH, lo que dificulta la preparación de las escuelas para garantizar un regreso seguro. Las encuestas de UNICEF en 2021 a 127 escuelas públicas en nueve estados muestran que todas las escuelas encuestadas tenían acceso limitado a los servicios WASH. Faltan puntos de lavado de manos adecuados incluso en los establecimientos de salud, donde más se necesitan: el 58% de los 130 establecimientos de salud evaluados en 11 estados no cuentan con instalaciones para el lavado de manos en los puntos de atención donde se trata a los pacientes. Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%. Esto pone a estudiantes, maestros, médicos, enfermeras, pacientes y a toda la población: en riesgo.
Para implementar WASH en instituciones, y comunidades adyacentes, en función del nivel de intervención se incluirán los siguientes elementos para la mejora de los servicios WASH, según la pertinencia y contexto:
•	Diagnóstico participativo de comunidades e instituciones, incluyendo elementos de género, AAP, discapacidad y participación adolescente;
•	Asegurar prácticas de higiene, de limpieza y de tratamiento y conservación del agua a través de actividades con enfoques comunitarios, que incluya la distribución de suministros básicos WASH, de acuerdo con las necesidades específicas de cada institución; así como su adecuado monitoreo y seguimiento;
•	Reparación, rehabilitación y acondicionamiento de instalaciones WASH prioritarias, bajo estándares de calidad, resiliencia, seguridad y sostenibilidad;
•	Formación de comités multidisciplinarios de gestión (instituciones y/o comunitarios), constituidos por personal técnico, administrativo, alumnos/pacientes y lideres comunitarios, para fortalecer capacidades y apoyar la implementación y monitoreo de actividades, bajo estándares de calidad (WASHFIT, WASHSIT, Directrices PCI, 3 estrellas, etc).
•	Distruibuicion de Incentivos, adecuación/dignificación de espacios a personal de mantenimiento y de limpieza, para reforzarla sostenibilidad de las intervenciones;

Adicionalmente, FAO, WFP y UNICEF están comprometidos a implementar programa integral, en escuelas de educación inicial y especial, y las comunidades y los servicios de salud a su alrededor para crear comunidades resilientes, utilizando escuelas como punto central de la comunidad, donde cada organizacion contribuirá en su área de expertise. El proyecto también se implementará en estrecha coordinación con las autoridades estadales como MINAGUAS, MPPE, MPPS, etc.

Los proyectos de Protección de NRC involucran el trabajo de dos equipos, por un lado, servicios especializados de protección y, por el otro lado, servicios de asistencia legal. 

Los proyectos de Protección contra violencia de NRC buscan reducir y mitigar el impacto de la violencia y el conflicto sobre individuos y comunidades expuestas al conflicto armado interno colombiano; inclusive riesgos de protección como amenazas, asesinatos, desplazamiento forzado, confinamiento, explotación, extorsión, robo, violencia basada en género, riesgos de minas y reclutamiento, uso y utilización por grupos armados. 

Las actividades de Protección contra violencia miran a prevenir la violencia antes de que ocurra, mientras se contribuye a la restauración de la seguridad para comunidades e individuos en riesgo. Se logra este resultado asegurando que los individuos sobrevivientes de violencia tengan recursos y capacidades de enfrentamiento mejoradas, aumentando la resiliencia y capacidad de mitigación frente a los riesgos de comunidades expuestas, fortaleciendo políticas públicas que protejan los individuos más vulnerables, y mejorando las capacidades de respuestas de instituciones y autoridades. 

Las actividades incluyen servicios individuales especializados de protección como gestión de casos y asistencia inmediata de protección, acompañamiento protectivo y apoyo psicosocial individual estructurado; acciones de autoprotección civil que incluyen mapeo de los riesgos dirigidos por las comunidades, aumento de capacidad en protección para miembros de comunidades, diseño y fortalecimiento de estrategias de autoprotección civil, asesoría y acompañamiento a las comunidades; actividades de fortalecimiento de entornos, incluyendo monitoreo y análisis de protección, protección por incidencia, y fortalecimiento de los mecanismos de coordinación de protección. Las actividades incluyen también intervención en contextos de emergencias como desplazamientos masivos, confinamientos, desastres naturales e incluyen evaluación rápida de necesidades de protección, asistencias de protección inmediata, entrenamientos en protección para líderes y lideresas, campañas de comunicación y talleres de manejo de estrés durante emergencias. 

En línea con la Estrategia de Protección de NRC, y dentro del contexto de respuesta a las dinámicas del conflicto armado en Colombia , el programa de protección se enfocará en personas afectadas por violencia, coerción y deprivación deliberadas con un énfasis particular en líderes y lideresas comunitarias, sociales y ambientalistas; comunidades expuestas a riesgos de protección como desplazamiento forzado, restricción de movilidad, confinamientos, amenazas, homicidios, violencia física y psicológica; individuos sobrevivientes o en riesgo de violencia, abuso, explotación, deprivación. 

Las intervenciones de protección contra violencia se priorizarán para los grupos más vulnerables como líderes/as sociales y defensores de derechos humanos, miembros de comunidades rurales, comunidades afrocolombianas e indígenas, mujeres y comunidad LGBTQI+. 

Con respecto a la respuesta por parte de ICLA, las personas desplazadas internas recibirán gestión de casos legales a través de la información, orientación y asistencia legal para acceso al registro de víctimas, acceso a derechos y servicios esenciales como educación y salud, acceso a identidad legal y regularización migratoria en el caso de las personas refugiadas y migrantes afectadas por el conflicto armado, acceso a derechos de vivienda tierra y propiedad y acceso a derechos de empleo.

Por un lado, la situación de violencia e inseguridad sigue impactando a miles de personas, evidenciado en el indicador de muertes violentas el cual registró un incremento de 6,7 por ciento con respecto al año anterior, llegando a una tasa de 17.3 por cada 100 mil habitantes, una de las más altas en Centro América. Los principales delitos denunciados son extorsión, hurto, robo, homicidios, lesiones, violencia sexual a NNA y mujeres adultas. A pesar de la mejora en ciertos indicadores de seguridad en el país, el alcance, control y violencia ejercida por grupos de delincuencia organizada continúa planteando serios desafíos a la protección de la población. Las pandillas poseen un amplio control en el país y están vinculadas a delitos violentos, extorsión, reclutamiento forzado y actividades relacionadas con el tráfico de drogas. Adicionalmente, las elecciones presidenciales y una transición política alterada, ha generado que los lideres indígenas se movilicen en protestas, generando varios bloqueos paralizando las principales rutas del país.  
Adicionalmente, las consecuencias del cambio climático en el área del corredor seco están provocando una crisis de inseguridad alimentaria, con cerca de 4.9 millones de personas afectadas, según el análisis del CIF (Clasificación Integrada en Fases) para el periodo junio/septiembre 2022; lo que representa un 25% del total de la población. Estas afectaciones incrementan situaciones de desigualdad, pobreza y de violencia, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG) y vulneración de los derechos de los niños, niñas y adolescentes, así como a grupos especialmente marginalizados como la población LGBTIQ+, indígena, en condición de discapacidad, generando desplazamiento al interior del país y hacia los países del norte del continente. 

Se estima, por lo tanto, que hay más de 2.9 millones de personas con necesidades de protección en Guatemala. Aproximadamente 41% de las personas con necesidades son mujeres adultas y un 40% NNA. Hasta diciembre de 2024, el clúster de protección proyecta cubrir las necesidades de al menos 810.000 personas. 

A esto se suma, que durante 2023 se generó un aumento del número de personas en movilidad humana (personas solicitantes de la condición de refugiado y refugiados, retornadas, desplazadas y migrantes en tránsito) que atraviesan el país. Según el Servicio Nacional de Migración de Panamá más de 400,000 personas habían cruzado el Darién en septiembre 2023, con la cifra más alta registrada en agosto 2023 de 82,000 personas. Los anuncios y cambios en la política migratoria regional de los EE. UU, han generado incertidumbre frente al futuro inmediato de las personas en Movilidad Humana y reflejan los desafíos institucionales que tiene el país para asegurar una respuesta adecuada y acceso a medidas de protección frente a la agudización de las necesidades humanitarias y recrudecimiento de las condiciones en la ruta (extorsiones, robos, violencia sexual).  

ACNUR Guatemala continuará trabajando con el gobierno, la sociedad civil y las comunidades para fortalecer el espacio de protección para refugiados, solicitantes de asilo, personas en movimientos mixtos y guatemaltecos con necesidades de protección; mediante la consolidación de iniciativas emprendidas en años anteriores. Para lograr nuestros objetivos de una manera más eficiente, nuestro enfoque basado en áreas contempla intervenciones priorizadas en comunidades con alta presencia de personas a las que servimos, en todas las áreas de responsabilidad.

Objective: UNICEF is committed to continuing to focus on critical unmet needs and remaining inequalities related to maternal, neonatal and under-five child survival.

Project Description: The project focuses on improving access and quality of basic services to address the multiple health deprivations faced by children, adolescents and pregnant women. UNICEF's response incorporates a child-centred approach and is built around community settings, including health centers and surrounding communities. Priority will be given to supporting health systems that reliably provide integrated service packages for children, adolescents and women, focusing on health, nutrition and WASH, also facilitating child protection services and linked to social protection and social well-being initiatives, as well as as well as the educational sector. , particularly for health promotion and prevention, improving health literacy, screening and promoting early childhood development and the mental health and well-being of children and their caregivers.

Strategies and implementation: UNICEF will promote three approaches to achieve the goals:
1. Address inequalities in health outcomes;
2. Strengthen health systems, including emergency preparedness, response and resilience; and
3. Promotion of integrated and multisectoral policies and programs.

The strategy also includes:
Strengthen service delivery, empower communities for health promotion, prevention and social behavior change, build capacity of health service providers, strengthen supply chain systems (essential products and equipment ), generate demand and strengthen accountability.

Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness of the project, UNICEF will implement a robust monitoring and evaluation system. This will involve periodic monitoring of health interventions, evaluations of health professionals after training and monitoring of the distribution and use of supplies, as well as evaluation of the quality of case management based on compliance with standardized protocols and regulations.

These actions will be implemented in selected urban, peri-urban and remote rural areas of 10 nationally prioritized states, with the exception of HIV interventions and immunization coverage is national, and will reach 750,303 people, including 559,291 children and 125,000 pregnant women .",,,"HAC-VENEZUELA	Japan	Venezuela	SM240465	Venezuela: Development of Cold Chain for the Expanded Programme on Immunization	Health Apoyo a niñas, niños, adolescentes y mujeres, especialmente a aquellos en condiciones de mayor vulnerabilidad, para incrementar su acceso a servicios de salud de calidad, más pertinentes, oportunos, incluyentes y eficaces, incluso en contextos de emergencia en 54 municipios.

Los factores que subyacen a la movilidad humana en El Salvador son diversos y complejos e incluyen, entre otros: desigualdad social, brechas de acceso a servicios básicos, violencia en sus diversas formas y ámbitos, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG), limitado acceso a empleo formal y oportunidades económicas, y pretensiones de reunificación familiar. 
Los desastres naturales y de origen humano, exacerbados por el cambio climático, agravan los factores subyacentes a la movilidad.

Para lograr esto, ACNUR impulsará acciones con otros actores para construir un entorno de protección favorable y abogará por salvaguardar los derechos y la dignidad de las personas y comunidades afectadas. Con un enfoque de área, ACNUR trabajará con sus socios para buscar soluciones al desplazamiento.

El proyecto de ACNUR está alineado con las prioridades nacionales, y contribuye al Plan de Acción Nacional del Marco Integral Regional para la Protección y Soluciones (MIRPS) y a los compromisos del II Foro Mundial sobre los Refugiados asumidos por El Salvador en 2023.

ACNUR brindará orientación y apoyo técnico a instituciones y partes interesadas clave para la inclusión de personas desplazadas internas en programas e iniciativas.

ACNUR desarrollará procesos de capacitación y fortalecimiento técnico a instituciones estatales y actores humanitarios. 

ACNUR asegurará la gestión de casos con la continuidad de implementación de cuatro Espacios de Apoyo “A tu lado” en Santa Ana, San Salvador, San Vicente y San Miguel en coordinación con socios e instituciones nacionales. Las Unidades Móviles “A tu lado” mejorarán el alcance de ACNUR para difundir información e identificar y remitir casos. ACNUR proporcionará a las personas asistencia en efectivo para cubrir las necesidades básicas de los casos identificados en mayor riesgo. 

En el marco del Equipo Humanitario de País, ACNUR liderará el Sector de Protección, asegurando que el Equipo Humanitario País responda adecuadamente a las necesidades de las personas desplazadas. 
ACNUR de la mano de sus socios fortalecerá 93 comunidades a través de procesos participativos con enfoque de edad, género y diversidad. Las intervenciones de ACNUR fomentarán la inclusión y el compromiso a través de la colaboración con 15 estructuras comunitarias como voluntarios, facilitadores judiciales, comités de jóvenes, líderes comunitarios, grupos de mujeres, comités locales, centros comunitarios CUBOS y los Centros de Integración Comunitaria (CIC) y Espacios de Apoyo. ACNUR fortalecerá iniciativas lideradas por las comunidades con las cuales trabaja y proyectos de coexistencia pacífica. ACNUR fortalecerá aún más los liderazgos de personas jóvenes y LGBTIQ+ en la búsqueda de soluciones. ACNUR garantizará que las mujeres y las niñas participen de manera equitativa y significativa.

ACNUR reforzará las oportunidades de medios de vida para las personas desplazadas internamente o en riesgo de desplazamiento, refugiados, solicitantes de asilo y personas retornadas con necesidades de protección de modo que logren la autosuficiencia y la inclusión económica. ACNUR con sus socios desarrollará programas sobre orientación al mercado e inserción laboral, emprendimiento y capital semilla, educación de formación profesional y educación de adultos. 

A través de un acuerdo directo con el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, ACNUR apoyará la estrategia de desarrollo de capacidades de la Comisión para la Determinación de la Condición de Refugiado (CODER) para aumentar las habilidades y conocimientos de su personal, e impulsará el marco legal y los protocolos internos de la institución. Bajo el liderazgo de CODER, ACNUR contribuirá a difundir el conocimiento y la información disponible sobre los derechos de la población refugiada y solicitante de asilo y el proceso de solicitud de refugio en El Salvador.
