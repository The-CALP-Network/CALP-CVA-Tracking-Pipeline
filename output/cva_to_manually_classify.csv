This contributes to SO1.
Based on the Food and Agriculture Sector 2018 sector strategy, approximately 6.5 million people are facing acute food insecurity with an additional 4 million at risk of falling into a situation of being food insecure. IDPs and people in besieged and Hard to Reach areas in addition to female headed households are between the most vulnerable groups that need food assistance to meet their minimum consumption needs. Women are increasingly becoming family breadwinners, heading more than third of the households.  Assistance to vulnerable groups with focus on female headed household will be prioritized. In addition, if the situation changed allowing a significant number of returnees among the IDPs and refugees, WFP will consider this group in the emergency general food assistance. WFP will consider various modalities as appropriate: including in-kind food assistance (Main modality for GFD) as well as cash based transfer (CBT). 
Emergency general food assistance is one of the four main activities/projects of WFP in 2018.

The overall objective of the project: saving lives, sustaining lives and protecting livelihoods through the provision of emergency and regular food assistance to the most vulnerable families affected by the crisis. This contributes to SO1.
Based on the Food and Agriculture Sector 2018 sector strategy, approximately 6.5 million people are facing acute food insecurity with an additional 4 million at risk of falling into a situation of being food insecure. IDPs and people in besieged and Hard to Reach areas in addition to female headed households are between the most vulnerable groups that need food assistance to meet their minimum consumption needs. Women are increasingly becoming family breadwinners, heading more than third of the households.  Assistance to vulnerable groups with focus on female headed household will be prioritized. In addition, if the situation changed allowing a significant number of returnees among the IDPs and refugees, WFP will consider this group in the emergency general food assistance. WFP will consider various modalities as appropriate: including in-kind food assistance (Main modality for GFD) as well as cash based transfer (CBT). 
Emergency general food assistance is one of the four main activities/projects of WFP in 2018.  It will be complemented by i) nutrition project, targeting women and children to prevent and respond to undernutrition, ii) livelihood project to re build livelihood and resilience, and iii) school meals project, targeting pupils to support their learning. 

The emergency general food assistance project is aligned with the objectives 1 and 4 of the Food Security Cluster:

This project will apply the standards set through technical guidelines on selected shelter activities drafted by the sector working group, UN partners and LRC to maximize impact, complement services and avoid duplication.

In response to the crisis, Caritas Lebanon (CL) will provide cash for shelter activities and minor renovation direct interventions to enable vulnerable households whose shelters were damaged to carry out essential repairs to ensure protection from the elements.

The proposed work builds on UN-Habitat's experience in repairing and rehabilitating structurally unsound heritage buildings accommodating vulnerable households in Saida and Tripoli in 2019. The current financial proposal is for immediate works COSTING 20% of the total structural repair cost. THE PER BUILDING COST OVER THE 3 MONTH FLASH APPEAL PERIOD IS $18,000, NOTING THAT EACH BUILDING IN THE TARGET AREAS (MAR MIKHAEL, KARANTINA) ACCOMMODATE APPROXIMATELY 8 HOUSEHOLDS [IE 100 BUILDINGS WITH 8 HH PER BUILDING = 800HH;  4 INDIVIDUALS PER HH = 3200 INDIVIDUALS], and that these areas contain concentrations of heritage structures which are both more expensive to address and more likely to have suffered sever damage. RESOURCE mobilisation for the remaining 80% IS underway. DONOR DISCUSSIONS ON a parallel initiative to undertake minor repairs in households in lightly damaged buildings (100 units) amounting to $0.128M  are at ADVANCED STAGES.

For the structurally unsound  buildings, the scope includes modern and heritage buildings in reflection of the building mix of the target area of Mar Mikhael & Karantina AS two of the most affected areas. In-house architectural and engineering expertise on structural works for heritage buildings will be utilised as needed. The project is geographically aligned to a blast-related CERF-funded ($800k) project UN-Habitat has already commenced with implementing partner PCPM on conditional cash for rent in Mar Mikhael (primary area) and Karantina (secondary area, anticipated gapfilling in soft collaboration with NRC); operational complementarities to meet the cash for rent needs of households evacuated from unsound buildings  will be addressed directly  through the CERF project and if necessary topped up through referrals. For the minor repairs, it is anticipated that buildings at some distance from the immediate blast zone will be targetted, in coordination with the Shelter sector,

Targetting of buildings will be based on
(1) Beirut Municipality Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA) survey of all buildings (which has been facilitated by UN-Habitat); 
(2) Field and phone survey of  occupiers of buildings surveyed (undertaken by UN-Habitat) in RDA that are evacuated or are to be evacuated;
(3) Emerging COMPREHENSIVE AND detailed assessments of damaged buildings by Order of Architects & Engineers IN BEIRUT MUNICIPALITY; 
(4) Household-level multisectoral needs analysis data from LRC.

The project will capitalise on UN-Habitat's links with the Order of Architects & Engineers as well as its staff presence currently embedded in Beirut Municipality Emergency Cell to engage in capacity-building on the shelter response to structural unsoundness, specifically at the levels of technical surveying and information management, technical works in the field and HLP awareness-raising to support the housing rights of evacuees among related issues.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.  As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.  The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021). Potential drought conditions will likely develop as a result of below average 2020 Deyr (Oct-Dec), a harsh 2021 dry Jilaal (Jan-Mar) season and a possible delay and/or poor performance of the 2021 Gu (Apr-Jun). 

Continued emergency relief alongside a further scale up of support to increase resilience is required in order to avert the hardship situation. WFP is therefore seeking resources in 2021 to sustain the on-going efforts and enable households meet immediate food needs and help build resilience against shocks. WFP is planning to implement unconditional and conditional transfers to improve access to food under integrated multi sectoral assistance to meet needs of vulnerable girls and women, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men and leverage resources with other partners to meet the level of humanitarian assistance required. WFP will continue to participate in cluster, joint planning, assessments and regular meetings with other humanitarian actors in Somalia.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.  As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.  The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021). Potential drought conditions will likely develop as a result of below average 2020 Deyr (Oct-Dec), a harsh 2021 dry Jilaal (Jan-Mar) season and a possible delay and/or poor performance of the 2021 Gu (Apr-Jun). 

Continued emergency relief alongside a further scale up of support to increase resilience is required in order to avert the hardship situation. WFP is therefore seeking resources in 2021 to sustain the on-going efforts and enable households meet immediate food needs and help build resilience against shocks. WFP is planning to implement unconditional and conditional transfers to improve access to food under integrated multi sectoral assistance to meet needs of vulnerable girls and women, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men and leverage resources with other partners to meet the level of humanitarian assistance required.

The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Baydhaba hosts high number of IDP (392,274 IDP) and has 110,905 primary school aged children. About 91,259 children (36,504F; 54,756M) are estimated to be in schools, while 162,239 are out of school children (OOSC) and 1,381 are IDP children with disability (CWD). In Diinsoor, 14,112 are primary school aged children, among those only 3,135 (1,163F; 1,972M) are enrolled in 8 primary schools, with 10,977 being OOSC and 226 CWD. In Ceel-barde there are 1,720 primary school aged children, with only 698 (414M;312F) enrolled in 3 public and IDP schools, while 1,032 (568M; 464F) are OOSC and 50 children are CWD. In Xudur, only 4,384 children (2,436M;1,948F) are currently enrolled in the 16 public and IDP schools, while 10,692 children (5,988M; 4,705F) remain out of schools and 151 are CWD (FCA needs assessment 09-10/20).

Major findings of FCA assessments in the four districts showed enormous shortage of accessible and gender friendly infrastructure such as latrines, handwashing facilities and classrooms, lack of learning and teaching materials, and inadequate number of qualified teachers especially female teachers. Girls face tremendous barriers in accessing to education due social norms that restrict their enrolment, retention and movement. The existing education system also reflects the persistence of these norms and does little to promote change in perception, attitude and behaviours. Children with disabilities met significant challenges such as strong stigma, discrimination and misconceptions, limited disability friendly infrastructure, poor learning environment and lack of specialised teachers trained in special education needs. Caregivers also faced with challenges in covering foods, school fees, uniforms and scholastic materials. Many of IDP children face significant health risks and psychological distress. Child protection and safeguarding mechanisms in schools are weak, due to lack of protection knowledge and relevant trainings among key education personnel. This has compromised the safety and well-being of the children, especially for girls and CWD in accessing education. 

Aligning with the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan, Education Sector Strategic Plan and Covid-19 Emergency Response Plan for Education, the initiative aims to restore and maintain access to safe, protective, inclusive and continuous learning opportunities for crises and emergency affected primary school boys and girls in Bay and Bakool regions of South West State of Somalia. The project will put a strong emphasis on an integrated approach to education focusing on access, quality of education, protection, child safeguarding, gender equality, conflict sensitivity, and disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the design, approach and activities. 

The project will remove barriers to primary education for 7,365 affected children (3,314F;4,051M), prioritising children from the most vulnerable groups such as IDPs, girls, CWD and destitute host community children. About 736 children with disability (331F;405M) will also be targeted (10%). Particularly, 40% IDP children, 60% destitute host community children and 45% of girls will benefit from the support.
 
FCA will partner with GREDO to implement some components of the project, particularly in relation to rehabilitation and construction of infrastructure, community mobilisation and protection mechanisms in schools. FCA will engage Somalia Institute for Special Education Needs and Disability (SISEN) for capacity building on inclusion and SEN for teachers, MoE and other education personnel. 

FCA has excellent capacity to scale up the approach and apply best practice in the four target locations built on its ongoing EiE response in Bay and Bakool regions and solid expertise as a well-known and trusted Finnish education actor.  
",,TRUE,"Right to Education for All for Displaced Children in Hard to Reach Areas of Southwest State of Somalia – READ Project Integrated Education in Emergencies Response for Crises Affected Children in Bay and Bakool regions of Somalia Bay and Bakool regions are among the most affected regions in Somalia by protracted droughts, flash floods and locust swarms, causing high displacement and acute humanitarian needs. Baydhaba hosts high number of IDP (392,274 IDP) and has 110,905 primary school aged children. About 91,259 children (36,504F; 54,756M) are estimated to be in schools, while 162,239 are out of school children (OOSC) and 1,381 are IDP children with disability (CWD). In Diinsoor, 14,112 are primary school aged children, among those only 3,135 (1,163F; 1,972M) are enrolled in 8 primary schools, with 10,977 being OOSC and 226 CWD. In Ceel-barde there are 1,720 primary school aged children, with only 698 (414M;312F) enrolled in 3 public and IDP schools, while 1,032 (568M; 464F) are OOSC and 50 children are CWD. In Xudur, only 4,384 children (2,436M;1,948F) are currently enrolled in the 16 public and IDP schools, while 10,692 children (5,988M; 4,705F) remain out of schools and 151 are CWD (FCA needs assessment 09-10/20).

Major findings of FCA assessments in the four districts showed enormous shortage of accessible and gender friendly infrastructure such as latrines, handwashing facilities and classrooms, lack of learning and teaching materials, and inadequate number of qualified teachers especially female teachers. Girls face tremendous barriers in accessing to education due social norms that restrict their enrolment, retention and movement. The existing education system also reflects the persistence of these norms and does little to promote change in perception, attitude and behaviours. Children with disabilities met significant challenges such as strong stigma, discrimination and misconceptions, limited disability friendly infrastructure, poor learning environment and lack of specialised teachers trained in special education needs. Caregivers also faced with challenges in covering foods, school fees, uniforms and scholastic materials. Many of IDP children face significant health risks and psychological distress. Child protection and safeguarding mechanisms in schools are weak, due to lack of protection knowledge and relevant trainings among key education personnel. This has compromised the safety and well-being of the children, especially for girls and CWD in accessing education. 

Aligning with the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan, Education Sector Strategic Plan and Covid-19 Emergency Response Plan for Education, the initiative aims to restore and maintain access to safe, protective, inclusive and continuous learning opportunities for crises and emergency affected primary school boys and girls in Bay and Bakool regions of South West State of Somalia. The project will put a strong emphasis on an integrated approach to education focusing on access, quality of education, protection, child safeguarding, gender equality, conflict sensitivity, and disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the design, approach and activities. 

The project will remove barriers to primary education for 7,365 affected children (3,314F;4,051M), prioritising children from the most vulnerable groups such as IDPs, girls, CWD and destitute host community children. About 736 children with disability (331F;405M) will also be targeted (10%). Particularly, 40% IDP children, 60% destitute host community children and 45% of girls will benefit from the support.

Specifically, the project will target 228,000 Nondisplaced people (children 107,160; men 41,040; women 36,480; elderly 9,120 and disabled 34,200) and 152,000 displaced populations (children 71,440; men 27,360; women 24,320; elderly 6,080 and disabled 22,800). 

IOM will rehabilitate 50 strategic water sources for multi-use that will provide continued, equitable, safe, sufficient and sustainable water to regions, targeted by the cluster, prone to natural disasters. 

IOM further proposes to construct 3,000 new emergency sanitation facilities (following cluster specifications) targeting populations without access to basic sanitation and hygiene.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Members States, community leaders and water committees/technicians for better coordination with government authorities and communities and sustainability of the constructed/ rehabilitated WASH infrastructures. In addition, the project will nurture community participation in good hygiene practices through training and community sensitization campaigns.  All trainings, awareness raising and capacity building activities will follow national guidelines on COVID-19 preventive measures, e.g. on physical distancing, to avoid mass gatherings and minimize risks of exposure.

The project is aligned with protection mainstreaming to ensure safety and dignity of affected populations without causing harm. Affected populations and all relevant stakeholders including men, women, boys, girls, elderly and people with disability will be involved in decision making throughout the project activities/cycle.

In 2020, over 4.6 million people (1.16 million IDPs and 3.36 million host communities) don’t have sufficient quantity of water and adequate sanitation (HNO 2020). This dire situation is even worsened by the COVID19 pandemic which require more water for frequent handwashing for prevention and containment. Schools in Somalia are reopening and due to COVID19, a number of schools are requesting urgent water supply for both students consumption and to support frequent handwashing. 

The water supply coverage in Somalia is strongly dependent on rainfall performance. In the last two rainy seasons namely 2019 Dayr and 2020 Gu, the performance of rains has improved slightly (SWALIM/FAO). From 2017 onwards, the water coverage has shown slight improvement due to improved rain performance. The National WASH Cluster estimates 59% as having sufficient drinking water with 66% of those with access walk less than 15 minutes for a water point and 20% having challenges to access the minimum quantity of safe water. (JMCNA ). 48% access their own improved latrines, while 52% use either unimproved latrines or practicing open defecation (22%) posing a huge public health risk. Furthermore, 2% used soap with water at latrines, 52% use soap at household level while 40% use other substitute for handwashing. 45% of women/girls access MHM materials. 
On the other hand, Oxfam needs assessment conducted late 2019 in Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions indicates that over 40% of both IDP and host communities rely on purchasing water from commercial trucks. There is no well-organized and reliable government data that shows the coverage of water, sanitation, and hygiene in Somalia. In December 2019 and January 2020, Oxfam and FAO/SWALIM conducted a WASH inventory in all regions of Somaliland. The inventory focused on sustainable and strategic water sources in the country including boreholes, springs, and protected shallow wells. The functionality of these sources is critical. However, the current functionality rate is estimated to be much below 70% and decreases as the stress level goes up during the drought period. The analysis of the final report is not yet finalized but expected to inform the sector on ways to increase functionality and reduce interruption of services. The COVID19 outbreak has increased the need for water to support frequent handwashing practices and this will further stress the few existing water sources. 
People living in the riverine areas in Somalia and other areas adjusted to seasonal rivers are affected by floods. The worst most recent flash-floods were reported from the Shabelle river basin particularly in Beletwayn town, Hiraan Region, and Qardho town of Puntland State. Until the end of May 2020, over 412,000 people are displaced by the floods (UNOCHA, Flood Bulletin). The capacity of regional states and the federal government is limited only to response instead of constructing large scale flood protection structures. 

Somalia is one of the worst hit Horn of African countries by COVID19. So far, over to 3,864 cases and 99 deaths are recorded. However, the figures are believed to be much higher since testing capacity is limited to only few major towns. The situation in Somalia is different compared to other countries with a strong governance system in the horn of Africa. Only 31% of people in Somalia reported having a functional handwashing facility with soap (WASH Cluster, March 2020). This estimate is based on an assessment conducted before the Covid19 lockdown. The federal government and humanitarian agencies confirmed the increased market price of soap and other detergents and 11% contraction of national GDP in the country. Covid19 prevention requires frequent handwashing and social distancing which both are difficult in Somalia context.

However, the figures are believed to be much higher since testing capacity is limited to only few major towns. The situation in Somalia is different compared to other countries with a strong governance system in the horn of Africa. Only 31% of people in Somalia reported having a functional handwashing facility with soap (WASH Cluster, March 2020). This estimate is based on an assessment conducted before the Covid19 lockdown. The federal government and humanitarian agencies confirmed the increased market price of soap and other detergents and 11% contraction of national GDP in the country. Covid19 prevention requires frequent handwashing and social distancing which both are difficult in Somalia context.

10%-20% decline in service coverage of essential maternal health care (ANC and post-natal care) may result in increasing of maternal deaths up to 2,056 -3,135 cases respectively.
There was not a tangible decline in institutional deliveries observed in the provinces where UNFPA mobile units are functional.  However, the number of ANC and Postnatal visits decreased by 30% due to lockdown and accessibility of the services. 
Distribution of COVID 19 positive cases among male and female population is unequal in different age groups. Most prevalent cases observed among male population in middle age group (65%). The impact of pandemic is frequently discussed by the government but more in economic terms and yet there is negligible mention of women or the gendered effects of the coronavirus. ‘The government’s approach towards women has always been paternalistic, and it is no different now; women are viewed as passive victims of a socio-economic and healthcare disaster’. 

Assessment conducted by OCHA in 2020 in collaboration with other UN organizations/agencies has unfold a gloomy picture of the health systems which also comes with some noticeable geographic disparities;  for instance; 
- Only 26.9% of the health facilities in Sajawal were having medicine available and on the other hand 88.9% of the health facilities in TM Khan were having medicine available in the health facility.
- Only 32.9% of deliveries take place in health facilities and 27.7% of post-natal care is provided by trained health staff. Recent estimates reveal that over 2.2 million people have limited or no access to essential health care services including women at reproductive age (15-49 years) 
- Access to health facilities by pregnant women is poor. For instance, only 52% in TM Khan and 28.2% in Sajawal have access to a health facility that assisting with birth 24/7, (Joint UN assessment 2020). 

Overall, 27% of the health facilities were reported as nonfunctional in the flood affected communities. Out of the functional health facilities only 27% providing 24/7 health care services. Overall, 52% of the respondents reported medicine available at the nearest health facilities, while 48% reported medicine were not available at the health facility.
The above situation is aggravated by:
- The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan has increased burden on the already weak health system. Many of the existing resources (human, equipment, infrastructure, funds etc) have been diverted to support COVID-19 response. This and the additional financial resources allocated from routine health programmes have impacted negatively on the delivery of health services particularly those entrapped in protracted crises, such as, Afghan Refugees and Temporary displaced persons.

10%-20% decline in service coverage of essential maternal health care (ANC and post-natal care) may result in increasing of maternal deaths up to 2,056 -3,135 cases respectively.
There was not a tangible decline in institutional deliveries observed in the provinces where UNFPA mobile units are functional.  However, the number of ANC and Postnatal visits decreased by 30% due to lockdown and accessibility of the services. 
Distribution of COVID 19 positive cases among male and female population is unequal in different age groups. Most prevalent cases observed among male population in middle age group (65%). The impact of pandemic is frequently discussed by the government but more in economic terms and yet there is negligible mention of women or the gendered effects of the coronavirus. ‘The government’s approach towards women has always been paternalistic, and it is no different now; women are viewed as passive victims of a socio-economic and healthcare disaster’. 

Assessment conducted by OCHA in 2020 in collaboration with other UN organizations/agencies has unfold a gloomy picture of the health systems which also comes with some noticeable geographic disparities;  for instance; 
- Only 26.9% of the health facilities in Sajawal were having medicine available and on the other hand 88.9% of the health facilities in TM Khan were having medicine available in the health facility.
- Only 32.9% of deliveries take place in health facilities and 27.7% of post-natal care is provided by trained health staff. Recent estimates reveal that over 2.2 million people have limited or no access to essential health care services including women at reproductive age (15-49 years) 
- Access to health facilities by pregnant women is poor. For instance, only 52% in TM Khan and 28.2% in Sajawal have access to a health facility that assisting with birth 24/7, (Joint UN assessment 2020). 

Overall, 27% of the health facilities were reported as nonfunctional in the flood affected communities. Out of the functional health facilities only 27% providing 24/7 health care services. Overall, 52% of the respondents reported medicine available at the nearest health facilities, while 48% reported medicine were not available at the health facility.
The above situation is aggravated by:
- The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan has increased burden on the already weak health system. Many of the existing resources (human, equipment, infrastructure, funds etc) have been diverted to support COVID-19 response.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.  As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.  The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of a La Niña that is currently developing (75 percent chance through Feb 2021).

Based on latest projections, 2.1 million Somalis are in IPC Phases 3 and above through December 2020. Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of the La Nina developing, which tends to trigger dry conditions in Somalia. If the forecast below-average Deyr rains (Oct-Dec 2020) is followed by below-average or delayed 2021 Gu rains (Apr-Jun), this could lead to a rapid and substantial worsening of the humanitarian situation. 

Rural populations are at a high risk of further deteriorating food security, given the direct and indirect impacts of these threats on rural livelihoods, related assets, food production and income. FAO’s proposal responds both to the lifesaving and life-sustaining needs of rural populations in IPC Phases 3 and above, against a Population in Need (PiN) of 3.1 million people prioritized for Food Security Cluster (FSC) assistance under the 2021 HRP. FAO’s planned activities will directly support 103,850 households in IPC 3-4 under both FSC Strategic Objectives (SOs), while further delivering support to protect food security in Somalia at a wider scale through countrywide animal health campaigns, among other activities. 

Under SO1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 76,300 rural households, including IDPs, in the form of Cash+, UCT and CFW activities delivered through FAO’s e-Platform for Mobile Money and Livelihood Assistance. All cash-based programmes include trainings on good nutrition practices, covering infancy to old age.

Under SO2, to protect livelihoods, FAO will provide in-kind and technical support to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security threats across Somalia’s rural livelihood zones, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to 53,500 households targeted for Cash+ interventions under SO1 (while supporting an additional 7,550 households with agricultural inputs only). FAO’s planned Cash+ activities combine cash transfers with tailored livelihood support packages to assist rural families out of hunger sooner. Alongside cash transfers, the assistance packages will protect and restore the livelihoods of households in IPC Phases 3-4 by providing: (i) farmers with quality inputs to produce a nutritious variety of food crop (cereal, pulse and vegetable seeds, storage bags, fertilizer and irrigation/tractor services, where appropriate; (ii) pastoralists with nutrient-rich feed blocks and deworming to improve livestock productivity especially milk supply; and (iii) coastal communities with a variety of basic fishing gear and processing equipment to improve catch and consumption.

",,TRUE,"Emergency life-saving support to Pastoral and Agro-pastoral households at risk of drought. Saving Lives and Livelihoods in Rural Somalia Somalia faced a growing number of threats to its food security in 2020, starting with the ongoing Desert Locust crisis, followed by COVID-19 first reported in March, severe flooding between April and September and poor rains forecast for the Deyr 2020 season. Based on latest projections, 2.1 million Somalis are in IPC Phases 3 and above through December 2020. Humanitarian needs could increase further in 2021 due to the influence of the La Nina developing, which tends to trigger dry conditions in Somalia. If the forecast below-average Deyr rains (Oct-Dec 2020) is followed by below-average or delayed 2021 Gu rains (Apr-Jun), this could lead to a rapid and substantial worsening of the humanitarian situation. 

Rural populations are at a high risk of further deteriorating food security, given the direct and indirect impacts of these threats on rural livelihoods, related assets, food production and income. FAO’s proposal responds both to the lifesaving and life-sustaining needs of rural populations in IPC Phases 3 and above, against a Population in Need (PiN) of 3.1 million people prioritized for Food Security Cluster (FSC) assistance under the 2021 HRP. FAO’s planned activities will directly support 103,850 households in IPC 3-4 under both FSC Strategic Objectives (SOs), while further delivering support to protect food security in Somalia at a wider scale through countrywide animal health campaigns, among other activities. 

Under SO1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 76,300 rural households, including IDPs, in the form of Cash+, UCT and CFW activities delivered through FAO’s e-Platform for Mobile Money and Livelihood Assistance. All cash-based programmes include trainings on good nutrition practices, covering infancy to old age.

Under SO2, to protect livelihoods, FAO will provide in-kind and technical support to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security threats across Somalia’s rural livelihood zones, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to 53,500 households targeted for Cash+ interventions under SO1 (while supporting an additional 7,550 households with agricultural inputs only). FAO’s planned Cash+ activities combine cash transfers with tailored livelihood support packages to assist rural families out of hunger sooner. Alongside cash transfers, the assistance packages will protect and restore the livelihoods of households in IPC Phases 3-4 by providing: (i) farmers with quality inputs to produce a nutritious variety of food crop (cereal, pulse and vegetable seeds, storage bags, fertilizer and irrigation/tractor services, where appropriate; (ii) pastoralists with nutrient-rich feed blocks and deworming to improve livestock productivity especially milk supply; and (iii) coastal communities with a variety of basic fishing gear and processing equipment to improve catch and consumption.

Specifically, the project will target 228,000 Nondisplaced people (children 107,160; men 41,040; women 36,480; elderly 9,120 and disabled 34,200) and 152,000 displaced populations (children 71,440; men 27,360; women 24,320; elderly 6,080 and disabled 22,800). 

IOM will rehabilitate 50 strategic water sources for multi-use that will provide continued, equitable, safe, sufficient and sustainable water to regions, targeted by the cluster, prone to natural disasters. 

IOM further proposes to construct 3,000 new emergency sanitation facilities (following cluster specifications) targeting populations without access to basic sanitation and hygiene.

The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Federal Government of Somalia and Federal Members States, community leaders and water committees/technicians for better coordination with government authorities and communities and sustainability of the constructed/ rehabilitated WASH infrastructures. In addition, the project will nurture community participation in good hygiene practices through training and community sensitization campaigns.  All trainings, awareness raising and capacity building activities will follow national guidelines on COVID-19 preventive measures, e.g. on physical distancing, to avoid mass gatherings and minimize risks of exposure.

The project is aligned with protection mainstreaming to ensure safety and dignity of affected populations without causing harm. Affected populations and all relevant stakeholders including men, women, boys, girls, elderly and people with disability will be involved in decision making throughout the project activities/cycle.

Conflict and environmental shocks have been the primary drivers of humanitarian needs in Somalia, leaving girls and boys out of school. According to the Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), 593,000 people were displaced in Somalia between January and September 2021, of which 420,000 were displaced due to conflict and 98,000 due to drought1. Of the people displaced this year, an estimated 237,200 (40%) are school-aged children. In total, there is about 2.9 million displaced people in Somalia and an estimated 1 million of these are school-aged children.

FCA rapid needs assessment (10/21) highlighted the challenges faced by the assessed schools in baidoa and Dinsoor  which include  lack of accessible and gender friendly structures such as chairs,  desks, classrooms, latrines and handwashing facilities, accompanied by shortage of learning and teaching materials such as books, pens and chalks. Lack of qualified and inadequate number of teachers, especially female teachers as well as teachers who are trained in special education needs to handle children with CWDs and negative cultural norms have contributed to the low enrolment, attendance and retention of girls and CwD in schools. The barriers faced by CwD are not limited to those faced by girls, but their enrolment, retention and movement to education are hindered by additional stigma, discrimination and misconceptions. Lack of adequate fencing of the school compound to promote protection and safety and long distances to school cause safety concerns particularly for girls. EiE actors require capacity to provide quality education to CwD. Caregivers also faced with challenges in covering school fees, uniforms and scholastic materials. Strengthening the involvement of community in school management activities and mainstreaming child protection and child safeguarding mechanisms into education will improve access to education for girls and CwD.
Aligning with the 2022 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan, the proposed initiative aims to restore and maintain access to and retention of crisis-affected school children to safe, protective, inclusive and continuous learning opportunities in Bay region of South West State of Somalia. The project will put a strong emphasis on an integrated approach to education focusing on access, quality of education, protection, child safeguarding, gender equality, conflict sensitivity, and disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the design, approach and activities. 
The proposed project will benefit 7100, crisis-affected children (4,400 children in Baidoa and 2,700 children in Dinsor) with at least 45% of girls. The vulnerable poor host community children (40%) will also be targeted since they are also affected by the crisis and have limited access to quality education. Protection and psychosocial well-being of the affected boys and girls as well as teachers is central to the project. FCA will closely work with Somalia Institute for Special Education Needs and Disability (SISEND), the only disability NGO in Somalia that specializes in special education needs, to provide capacity building to teachers, MoE and other education personnel. 
FCA has excellent capacity to scale up, applying best practices and lessons learned from its EiE experiences in other districts of South West State (Baidoa, El-berde and Hudur) to Dinsoor.. Utilizing FCA integrated and innovative approach based on well-known Finnish education system, FCA will take into account the potential impact of Covid-19 pandemic and develop innovative solutions to ensure uninterrupted access to education by the target children.

The proposed project will be implemented in Baidoa and Dinsoor where there are high number of IDP and are in IPC 3. The implementation will be done in close partnership with GREDO; a local NGO that is currently partnering with FCA on the ECHO funded EiE Projects.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices. 

Under FSC Objective 2, to protect livelihoods and related food sources, FAO will provide in-kind, technical support and tailored trainings to 112,500 HHs to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security and nutrition threats, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to targeted HHs. In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition.

It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production.

Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

",,TRUE,"WFP Integrated Response to Prevent Famine in Bay, Banadir and Mudug regions of Somalia. WFP SOMALIA 2022 HRP - FSC Somalia has been impacted by multiple shocks in 2020, including desert locust invasion, flash floods and COVID-19. This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas.

Este programa inició en 2021 con comidas escolares en emergencias priorizando escuelas iniciales y de educación especial.

WFP proporciona comidas escolares acompañado de un paquete integrado de intervenciones para mejorar el acceso a alimentos nutritivos y diversificados a través de las escuelas, contribuyendo al mismo tiempo a mejorar la salud y la nutrición de los niños en edad escolar, los estudiantes con discapacidad y el personal escolar, y apoyando a las comunidades a reducir la dependencia en estrategias de afrontamiento. De manera gradual, el WFP está realizando compras locales de alimentos, e incluyendo acciones para apoyar los mercados locales con compras a pequeños productores y apoyo técnico para acceso a mercados.

En este sentido, el programa de comidas escolares en emergencias tiene los siguientes componentes, para asegurar un enfoque integral que apoye al estudiante en el entorno escolar y familiar:

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar a través de comida en especie o transferencias monetarias.
3. Rehabilitación de cocinas escolares para garantizar condiciones adecuadas de preparación de alimentos.
4. Comunicación para sensibilizar acerca de los principios humanitarios, la adecuada preparación de alimentos, nutrición, higiene y mantenimiento de cocinas escolares.

Este programa inició en 2021 con comidas escolares en emergencias priorizando escuelas iniciales y de educación especial.

WFP proporciona comidas escolares acompañado de un paquete integrado de intervenciones para mejorar el acceso a alimentos nutritivos y diversificados a través de las escuelas, contribuyendo al mismo tiempo a mejorar la salud y la nutrición de los niños en edad escolar, los estudiantes con discapacidad y el personal escolar, y apoyando a las comunidades a reducir la dependencia en estrategias de afrontamiento. De manera gradual, el WFP está realizando compras locales de alimentos, e incluyendo acciones para apoyar los mercados locales con compras a pequeños productores y apoyo técnico para acceso a mercados.

En este sentido, el programa de comidas escolares en emergencias tiene los siguientes componentes, para asegurar un enfoque integral que apoye al estudiante en el entorno escolar y familiar:

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar a través de comida en especie o transferencias monetarias.
3. Rehabilitación de cocinas escolares para garantizar condiciones adecuadas de preparación de alimentos.
4. Comunicación para sensibilizar acerca de los principios humanitarios, la adecuada preparación de alimentos, nutrición, higiene y mantenimiento de cocinas escolares.

This has led to HH food insecurity, sharp increase in debt levels among poor HHs and poor animal health and produce. 
A delayed and poor Deyr season, worsened drought conditions in the target regions resulting in majority of HHs having inadequate access to food and water while staple food and commodity prices have risen at an average of 8.5% in Gedo and 24% in Bay regions over the past year (COOPI PNA, Oct 2021). From October to December 2021, food insecurity is expected to further deteriorate among poor rural, urban, and displaced populations due to the impacts of anticipated, below-average 2021 Deyr (October-December) season rainfall, continued insecurity and other food security related risk factors, including rising food prices and cost of living, declining availability of milk for both consumption and sale, and a likely reduction in agricultural employment opportunities during the forthcoming Deyr season.
The project focuses on the delivery of basic lifesaving and protection/restoration of livelihoods of the target population with a special focus on all locations with FSC prioritized persons in need, including IDPs and host communities that are classified in IPC Phase 3 & 4 in terms of response. 
The project is aimed at improving the ability of vulnerable HHs to meet their basic needs, supports protection and recovery of livelihood assets through life-saving UCT, animal treatment services, provision of locally preferred high quality seeds kits and trainings, and rehabilitation of community productive assets through CFW to support the resilience of vulnerable populations against shocks and prevent them from slipping into acute food insecurity. The proposed project aims to target at least 6,600 HHs (39,600) pastoral, agro-pastoral and IDP HHs in Bay, Banadir, Gedo and Togdheer regions in crisis and emergency with delivery of life saving interventions in line with the strategic objectives of the HRP and FSC response plan.
The project is informed by the centrality of protection and a gender, age and diversity-sensitive approach which is mainstreamed throughout the project cycle. Moreover, the project reflects the principles of COOPI Protection Policy and is built consistently with COOPI Protection SOPs and Protection Mainstreaming guidelines. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. COOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation, the beneficiary women, girls and the disabled will be included in decision making processes and in monitoring so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence.
In summary the following activities will be carried out:
1.	Provide UCT to 3,100 HHs that are faced with severe levels of food insecurity (crisis and emergency) with the aim of improving immediate access to food for 3 months.
2.	Rehabilitation of community productive assets through CFW targeting 1,000 vulnerable HHs.
3.	Provision of locally preferred high quality seed kits, trainings and fuel for irrigation for 500 flood affected female and male headed vulnerable riverine farmers in Bele-Hawa Gedo region.
4.	Provision of locally preferred high quality seeds kit (drought tolerant) and trainings for 1,000 female and male headed vulnerable agro-pastoral farmers in Burhakaba district, Bay region.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

",,TRUE,"Food Security	HRPs for  Somalia WFP SOMALIA 2022 HRP - FSC Somalia has been impacted by multiple shocks in 2020, including desert locust invasion, flash floods and COVID-19. This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices. 

Under FSC Objective 2, to protect livelihoods and related food sources, FAO will provide in-kind, technical support and tailored trainings to 112,500 HHs to anticipate, mitigate and respond to food security and nutrition threats, including the delivery of integrated cash and livelihood support to targeted HHs. In addition, FAO shall provide transitional cash support to 13,100 HHs across agro pastoral, pastoral and fishing livelihood zones to augment the adaptive capacity of HHs, strengthen and foster resilience to future shocks, cushioning them from food insecurity and malnutrition. Trainings shall be delivered alongside input provision to build skills in sustainable use of resources provided, build skills in livelihoods management including harvest, post- harvest management, linking beneficiaries to long- term interventions that provide them opportunities to enhance their livelihoods and skills.",,TRUE,"FOOD ASSISTANCE Emergency Lifesaving Cash and Livelihood Support to IDP and Non- IDP Communities in Somalia Somalia is facing a severe and deteriorating humanitarian crisis as we enter 2022 as a result of the compounding effects of conflict, recurrent climate shocks, diseases and pests outbreaks with increased levels of vulnerability and substantial increase in the humanitarian caseload (Somalia HNO, 2022). There is a serious risk that the impact of consecutive below average to poor rainfall in most parts of the country will develop into a severe drought by early to mid- 2022 with the number of people facing acute food insecurity on the rise. It is likely that minority groups, women, children, people with disabilities, will experience heightened protection risks as a result, unless they are intentionally targeted to receive tailored assistance.

With approximately 3.5 million individuals in IPC 3 and 4 through at least December 2021, FAO proposes to target 160,300 households (961,800 individuals- 91,500 IDPs and 870,300 non- IDPs) in IPC 3 and IPC 4 caseloads respectively. This will include 216,790 women, 254,492 girls, 264,880 boys and 225,638 men and 144,270 people living with disabilities (PWD) across 59 districts in Somalia through its flagship Cash+ approach combining short-term cash transfers with tailored livelihood support in accordance with technical and humanitarian standards. Vulnerable households will identified from at-risk pastoral, agro-pastoral, fishing, riverine farmers, IDPs and Non- IDP communities in IPC 3 and 4 areas. This intervention will integrate short-term cash transfers aimed at enabling the most vulnerable households to meet their immediate needs, with livelihood support to allow crisis-affected households to get back into production. FAO will employ community- led beneficiary selection processes and ensure adequate targeting and representation of extremely vulnerable and minority groups in community committees. Interventions proposed will employ a Do No Harm approach with a gender lens that ensures conflict- sensitivity to reduce protection risks for all individuals, and to mitigate the risk of conflict or community tensions. 

Under Food Security Cluster (FSC) Objective 1, to improve access to food, FAO will deliver lifesaving cash assistance to 160,300 households through a blend of conditional (Cash-for-Work) and unconditional (UCT) transfers. Under UCT, FAO will prioritize Cash+ interventions including Cash+ Agriculture, Cash+ livestock and Cash+ fisheries. These modalities will increase households’ immediate access to food by providing sufficient cash to access the minimum expenditure basket (MEB), while supporting the rehabilitation of critical productive and community infrastructure. It will also boost household food production, increase household incomes and create employment opportunities. Cash transfer values will be informed by the Cash Working Group and are expected to differ per district/ region of intervention. They, however, will be valued at 80 percent of the food MEB, which can range from USD 50- 100 per month. All cash-based programmes will include training on good nutrition practices.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

The principle drivers being the deepened armed conflict in many parts of South-Central Somalia and erratic climatic conditions with flooding and drought happening simultaneously in different parts of the Country. 
This coupled with COVID 19 pandemic, not only hampers access to basic services but also leads to increased marginalization of minority groups, displaced persons and persons with special needs, heightened protection risks, loss of livelihoods and income, and limited freedom of movement. In addition, communities have reduced coping capacities and resilience, with women and girls, minority clan members, and people living with disabilities being disproportionately affected. With the country gearing for state and federal elections, there is the likelihood of displacements and disruptions of lives amid intensified attacks from non-state actors. Recent conflicts and violence in mid-2021 displaced 250,000 people in Banaadir, Bardaale and Badweyn, including nearly 207,000 people who were temporally displaced in Mogadishu owing to election-related violence in April 2021. This against a backdrop of limited and constrained humanitarian assistance will not only result in loss of lives, affected livelihoods and destroyed property, but also increased vulnerabilities and heightened protection risks for vulnerable groups.
Data from the PRMN, SPMS and MRM systems designates heightened protection risks in the country with over 4 million people projected to need lifesaving protection assistance (HNO, 2021).  The GBV AOR reported a spike in Intimate Partner Violence, rape, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and abuse against women and girls in 2021 most of which are from displacement affected communities. Furthermore, accruing to the MRM data, Somalia is now the most dangerous conflict on earth for children, where over 23,000 grave violations were recorded in the last 5 year, and of concern is the number of child recruitment and abductions far exceeding any other country in the world. 
Thus, DRC will design and implement interventions targeting the most vulnerable persons in the communities including DACs, girls, women, boys, and men at risk of/ survivors of GBVs, minority groups/clans, persons with disabilities, children and adults affected by armed violence including explosive remnants of wars (ERWs) and other explosive devices, people at risk of forced evictions and most vulnerable host communities to strengthening capacity and the commitment of families and communities to protect communities especially children and women from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, through elimination of harmful practices and all forms of gender-based violence, provision of timely holistic and quality age and gender appropriate services to survivors, persons at risks and vulnerable persons including PSNs in addition to strengthened community-based protection systems.
The proposed interventions thus align with the general protection, GBV, Explosive Hazards (EH) and Housing, Land and Property (HLP) cluster objectives and indicators and the Strategic objectives 1, 2 and 3 of 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan.  The interventions will employ participatory and right based approaches, age, gender and diversity (AGD) approach and community-based child protection approaches which will involve, inclusion of children and caregivers from refugee’s/asylum seeker communities, migrants, IDPs, persons with disability and most vulnerable host communities in addition to local authorities in the project management cycle.

Decades of conflict and natural disasters including repeated droughts and seasonal flooding followed by limited government and institutional support have had a profound negative effect on the food security situation and social service sector in Somalia. Nearly seven in ten Somalis live on less than USD 1.90 per day,  the sixth-highest poverty rate in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty is both widespread and deep, particularly for households in rural areas and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements. The number of food-insecure people experiencing long-term stress is trending upwards, indicating that chronic food insecurity persists, requiring sustainable solutions. Recurrent climate-related shocks and political instability are key drivers of food insecurity and pose continuing risks to crop production and food access. Malnutrition in Somalia is driven by a combination of factors such as recurrent food insecurity, child illnesses, high morbidity, micronutrient deficiencies, low immunization levels, poor access to clean water and sanitation, poor hygiene practice, gender inequality and discriminatory sociocultural attitudes leading to poor care practices. Based on the latest Post Gu FSNAU assessment (September 2021), it is estimated that a total of 3.5 million out of the 15.8m people face acute food insecurity (IPC 3 and above – crisis or worse)  until December 2021. At the national level the median prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) has remained at a serious level of 11.1%. Approximately 1.2 million children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished, including 295,515 who are likely to be severely malnourished. In addition to this, around 245,909 Pregnant & Lactating Women (PLWs) will be at risk of acute malnutrition. 

Acute malnutrition is a major public health problem in Somalia. It affects disproportionately children under the age of five, as well as Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLWs), especially among IDPs, vulnerable (agro) pastoralist communities and those living in areas affected by flooding. Morbidity among children is high (≥ 20%). Out of a total of 40 surveyed population groups 18 recorded high morbidity presence of above 20%. 
Vitamin A supplementation and Measles vaccination remains low <40% in several population groups. 

TB prevalence remains one of the highest globally with Somalia in the top 10 countries with high TB burden (262 per 100,000 population) while the HIV prevalence remains <1% however with high stigma and discrimination levels at 94%.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

A medida que Venezuela soporta su octavo año consecutivo de contracción económica agravada por hiperinflación, tensiones políticas, sanciones, aumento de violencia y exposición a desastres naturales, el costo para la sociedad y niños empeora. Los impactos de COVID-19 han intensificado esta situación, dejando a miles de NNAs con necesidades de educación, inmunización, medicamentos, nutrición, agua potable y protección. La mala calidad y cantidad del agua, combinadas con intermitencia, son preocupaciones clave en Venezuela, lo que hace que el lavado de manos, una medida clave de prevención de infecciones, sea extremadamente desafiante.
Entre agosto y septiembre de 2021, el OSPV informó que 65,6% de la población consideraba que el servicio de agua era inadecuado, y solo 27,2% de la población en ciudades tenía suministro regular de agua. Antes de la pandemia, 61% de escuelas carecían de acceso diario a agua potable segura y la ausencia de servicios WASH en ellas fue la causa del ausentismo escolar en 28% de los casos (HNO OCHA, 2019). Con las medidas de contención de la COVID-19, las escuelas estuvieron parcialmente cerradas durante más de 18 meses. La falta de limpieza, desinfección y mantenimiento de los servicios durante el cierre prolongado de las escuelas ha resultado en un mayor deterioro de los servicios de WASH, lo que dificulta la preparación de las escuelas para garantizar un regreso seguro. Las encuestas de UNICEF en 2021 a 127 escuelas públicas en nueve estados muestran que todas las escuelas encuestadas tenían acceso limitado a los servicios WASH. Faltan puntos de lavado de manos adecuados incluso en los establecimientos de salud, donde más se necesitan: el 58% de los 130 establecimientos de salud evaluados en 11 estados no cuentan con instalaciones para el lavado de manos en los puntos de atención donde se trata a los pacientes. Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%. Esto pone a estudiantes, maestros, médicos, enfermeras, pacientes y a toda la población: en riesgo.
Para implementar WASH en instituciones, y comunidades adyacentes, en función del nivel de intervención se incluirán los siguientes elementos para la mejora de los servicios WASH, según la pertinencia y contexto:
•	Diagnóstico participativo de comunidades e instituciones, incluyendo elementos de género, AAP, discapacidad y participación adolescente;
•	Asegurar prácticas de higiene, de limpieza y de tratamiento y conservación del agua a través de actividades con enfoques comunitarios, que incluya la distribución de suministros básicos WASH, de acuerdo con las necesidades específicas de cada institución; así como su adecuado monitoreo y seguimiento;
•	Reparación, rehabilitación y acondicionamiento de instalaciones WASH prioritarias, bajo estándares de calidad, resiliencia, seguridad y sostenibilidad;
•	Formación de comités multidisciplinarios de gestión (instituciones y/o comunitarios), constituidos por personal técnico, administrativo, alumnos/pacientes y lideres comunitarios, para fortalecer capacidades y apoyar la implementación y monitoreo de actividades, bajo estándares de calidad (WASHFIT, WASHSIT, Directrices PCI, 3 estrellas, etc).
•	Distruibuicion de Incentivos, adecuación/dignificación de espacios a personal de mantenimiento y de limpieza, para reforzarla sostenibilidad de las intervenciones;

Adicionalmente, FAO, WFP y UNICEF están comprometidos a implementar programa integral, en escuelas de educación inicial y especial, y las comunidades y los servicios de salud a su alrededor para crear comunidades resilientes, utilizando escuelas como punto central de la comunidad, donde cada organizacion contribuirá en su área de expertise.

Renforcement des capacités étatiques et des services sociaux de base dans les départements cibles pour une meilleure prise en charge des personnes en mobilité et notamment des enfants, y compris des survivant-e-s VBG et des victimes de traite : Un cycle de formation sur la protection des victimes de traite en situation de crise, permettant aussi de vulgariser le mécanisme national de référencement des victimes de traite, sera organisé pour tout acteur de la chaine de protection dans les communes cibles, dont les travailleurs sociaux de la protection de l’enfance et des organisations de la société civile (OSC). Il comprendra également des sessions sur la spécificité de la prise en charge des enfants non accompagnés en contexte humanitaire, et les besoins spécifiques des survivantes de VBG. 
2. Prévention des violences notamment envers les enfants, les femmes et les personnes en situation d'handicap, y compris de survivants de  VBG et diverses exploitations, à travers le renforcement des mécanismes communautaires de protection, l’appui aux leaders communautaires et la mobilisation des filles et garçons : En collaboration avec les DDPFPE, les mairies et les OSC, une cartographie et évaluation des besoins des structures communautaires, y compris les comités de protection, les espaces amis des enfants, les espaces surs et les écoles coraniques accueillant des enfants déplacés, seront réalisées. Suite à cette analyse, l’OIM les appuiera en matériel, afin que ces dernières puissent jouer leur rôle de protection. Leurs compétences seront renforcées afin qu’ils puissent signaler et référer les cas de protection, mais aussi qu’ils développent des actions de prévention qui encouragent des normes et comportements positifs favorisant des communautés respectueuses, égalitaires, et non violentes à l'égard des femmes et des filles. Des appuis aux initiatives des jeunes pour qu’ils sensibilisent leurs pairs seront réalisés. 
3. Atténuation des risques de protection dans les zones ciblées : En vue de prévenir l’adoption de stratégies de survie négatives des populations et de promouvoir leur dignité, l’OIM poursuivra la distribution des kits de protection adaptés aux besoins,  identifiés avec les populations. Enfin, l'organisation continuera le renforcement de la sécurité sur les sites d'intervention de l'équipe Abris et BNA & WASH afin de contribuer à la réduction des risques de protection. 
4. Offre de services de soutien psychosocial et de santé mentale (SMSPS) aux personnes déplacées, notamment les enfants, aux survivants de VBG et aux communautés hôtes : La stratégie de services de SMSPS de l’OIM est basée sur son expertise acquise auprès des migrants vulnérables et conformément aux principes développés par le « manuel de santé mentale et soutien psychosocial communautaire en situations d’urgence et de déplacement » (OIM, 2021). Des activités de sensibilisation et de formations des leaders communautaires et d’agents de santé sont organisées au préalable. Des équipes mobiles composées notamment d’un-e travailleur-se social-e, d’un-e infirmier-ère, d’un-e pyschologue, d’un-e mobilisateur-trice communautaire, se déplaceront pour offrir des activités psychosociales aux populations hôtes et déplacées, notamment là où les structures communautaires sont inexistantes.

1. Entrega de comidas escolares nutritivas para estudiantes y personal escolar, promoviendo las compras locales y a pequeños productores.
2. Apoyo a la seguridad alimentaria del hogar.
3. Rehabilitación de cocinas escolares para garantizar condiciones adecuadas de preparación de alimentos.
4. Comunicación para sensibilizar acerca de los principios humanitarios, la adecuada preparación de alimentos, nutrición, higiene y mantenimiento de cocinas escolares.
5. Fortalecimiento de capacidades de socios implementadores y personal escolar.
6. Acciones sensibles a la nutrición, que incluyen, tamizaje en las escuelas, educación nutricional, referencia a servicios especializados y entrega de alimento complementario fortificado (Super Cereal Plus).",None,FALSE,Full,Project API + ML,Full,0.59927094,1,0,Manual,FALSE

Con el objetivo principal de contribuir a poner fin a las muertes prevenibles de madres, recién nacidos y niños, al tiempo que se promueve la salud y el desarrollo de todos los niños, en el sector de la salud UNICEF aplicará dos enfoques: abordar las desigualdades en los resultados sanitarios y fortalecer los sistemas de salud, incluida la prevención y la respuesta al COVID-19.

Decades of conflict and natural disasters including repeated droughts and seasonal flooding followed by limited government and institutional support have had a profound negative effect on the food security situation and social service sector in Somalia. Nearly seven in ten Somalis live on less than USD 1.90 per day,  the sixth-highest poverty rate in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty is both widespread and deep, particularly for households in rural areas and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements. The number of food-insecure people experiencing long-term stress is trending upwards, indicating that chronic food insecurity persists, requiring sustainable solutions. Recurrent climate-related shocks and political instability are key drivers of food insecurity and pose continuing risks to crop production and food access. Malnutrition in Somalia is driven by a combination of factors such as recurrent food insecurity, child illnesses, high morbidity, micronutrient deficiencies, low immunization levels, poor access to clean water and sanitation, poor hygiene practice, gender inequality and discriminatory sociocultural attitudes leading to poor care practices. Based on the latest Post Gu FSNAU assessment (September 2021), it is estimated that a total of 3.5 million out of the 15.8m people face acute food insecurity (IPC 3 and above – crisis or worse)  until December 2021. At the national level the median prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) has remained at a serious level of 11.1%. Approximately 1.2 million children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished, including 295,515 who are likely to be severely malnourished. In addition to this, around 245,909 Pregnant & Lactating Women (PLWs) will be at risk of acute malnutrition. 

Acute malnutrition is a major public health problem in Somalia. It affects disproportionately children under the age of five, as well as Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLWs), especially among IDPs, vulnerable (agro) pastoralist communities and those living in areas affected by flooding. Morbidity among children is high (≥ 20%). Out of a total of 40 surveyed population groups 18 recorded high morbidity presence of above 20%. 
Vitamin A supplementation and Measles vaccination remains low <40% in several population groups. 

TB prevalence remains one of the highest globally with Somalia in the top 10 countries with high TB burden (262 per 100,000 population) while the HIV prevalence remains <1% however with high stigma and discrimination levels at 94%.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation.

According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks.

En este sentido, durante el periodo 2020-2021, la cobertura del Programa de Alimentación Escolar (PAE) ha tenido deficiencia en frecuencia, ingesta nutricional y dieta equilibrada para no menos de 4.5 millones de niños y se estima que alrededor de 1.1 millones corren el riego de abandonar la Escuela. Al mismo tiempo, la disminución continua de la producción local de alimentos se agrava por el limitado acceso a insumos agrícolas esenciales -como semillas con calidad- por parte de los pequeños productores, agravando la inseguridad alimentaria y financiera preexistente en las comunidades.
Por lo anterior expuesto, la presente acción tiene como propósito principal el de mejorar la SAN de niños y niñas en edad escolar, además de los hogares rurales en situación de vulnerabilidad, esto, mediante el desarrollo de modelos de Alimentación Escolar basados en la producción local que FAO y UNICEF han pilotado y validad en cuatro estados del país. Complementariamente, la acción promoverá esquemas comunitarios de producción variada de semillas de forma artesanal, adaptadas climáticamente y que respetan la cultura y saberes locales productivos. 
Bajo este objetivo, se propone el desarrollo de los siguientes componentes:
PRODUCTO 1: Fortalecido el modelo de Alimentación Escolar basado en la producción local de la Agricultura Familiar (AF): A través de rehabilitar y/o mejorar las capacidades productivas de las Escuelas Técnicas Agrícolas (ETA) y Asociación Local de Productores (ALP) incrementando su productividad aplicando prácticas agroecológicas para producción de alimentos, huevos y semillas, además desarrollando acciones de asistencia técnica. Se espera que, con la disponibilidad de una producción local de huevos, hortalizas y frutas, se logre fomentar modelos alimentarios de circuito corto, saludables y sostenibles, en donde los niños y niñas de edad escolar en situación de vulnerabilidad - y de manera indirecta el de familias vulnerables de agricultores de pequeña escala - mejoran el consumo de alimentos diversificados, frescos y nutritivos.
PRODUCTO 2: Mejorado el acceso a semillas con calidad, por parte de los pequeños productores familiares locales; a través de una implementación de un modelo de producción de semillas comunitario, sostenibles y resilientes. En este modelo, las ETA jugarán un rol de motor de producción y difusión de conocimiento y los productores a través de las ALP, serán el factor de escalamiento de la capacidad de producción y accesibilidad de la semillas para los demás productores
Para la implementación del proyecto se han priorizado estados con población indígena y, cuando sea posible, se dará la prioridad de participación a agricultoras y agricultores indígenas y a mujeres líderes de hogar, en los estados Amazonas, Sucre, Monagas, Falcon, Zulia, Delta Amacuro, Bolívar y Apure. La acción espera dar cobertura a alrededor de 13 750 hogares de pequeños productores y productoras, aglutinando alrededor de 450 grupos productivos y/o Bancos de Semillas Comunitarios, que contribuyan a la protección y acumulación de sus medios de vida productivos esenciales y en conjunto con 50 ETAs y 25 escuelas de educación básica y primaria, puedan abastecer complementos alimentarios frescos y sanos para alrededor 27 000 niños y niñas en edad escolar.

This has negatively affected the ability of vulnerable households to meet their food security needs. The urban poor, including IDP households, have been disproportionally affected due to the socio-economic effects from COVID-19 due their heavy reliance on food purchases from the market and casual labor as the main sources of income. These households are likely to face food consumption gaps due to declines in employment and income-earning opportunities. The desert locust caused significant damage to cereal crops, fruits, vegetables and pasture in the northern and central regions. Control efforts of the government and partners in Somaliland and Puntland made progress, but an increasing number of adult locust groups was reported in central regions. In addition, in the northeast, remained swarms have matured, and some have moved towards central areas. As per FAO, the hatching and band formation is occurring now and more swarms are likely to move to other areas in central Somalia and at later stages are expected to move towards crop producing areas in the south; which can have some negative impact to the crops and pasture up to early next year.

The impact of localized flooding particularly in riverine areas destroyed farmland and crops and caused population displacement, leading to significant crop losses and the loss of income from agricultural employment.

Jointly with the Government and other humanitarian actors, WFP Somalia has supported communities and vulnerable houses impacted by the multiple shocks. The high levels of sustained humanitarian assistance in 2020 have played a critical role in stabilizing the situation. The immediate food security outlook for Somalia however looks bleak despite the efforts sustained in 2020. According to the latest Post-Gu Assessment, 2.1 million people are expected to be food insecure (IPC 3 and 4) across Somalia through December 2020. An additional 3 million people are expected to be Stressed (IPC 2), bringing the total number of people facing cute food insecurity to 5.1 million until the end of this year. Based on results of the 2020 Post Gu assessment, an estimated 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition between September 2020 and August 2021, including 143,400 likely to be severely malnourished.

Las actividades incluyen servicios individuales especializados de protección como gestión de casos y asistencia inmediata de protección, acompañamiento protectivo y apoyo psicosocial individual estructurado; acciones de autoprotección civil que incluyen mapeo de los riesgos dirigidos por las comunidades, aumento de capacidad en protección para miembros de comunidades, diseño y fortalecimiento de estrategias de autoprotección civil, asesoría y acompañamiento a las comunidades; actividades de fortalecimiento de entornos, incluyendo monitoreo y análisis de protección, protección por incidencia, y fortalecimiento de los mecanismos de coordinación de protección. Las actividades incluyen también intervención en contextos de emergencias como desplazamientos masivos, confinamientos, desastres naturales e incluyen evaluación rápida de necesidades de protección, asistencias de protección inmediata, entrenamientos en protección para líderes y lideresas, campañas de comunicación y talleres de manejo de estrés durante emergencias. 

En línea con la Estrategia de Protección de NRC, y dentro del contexto de respuesta a las dinámicas del conflicto armado en Colombia , el programa de protección se enfocará en personas afectadas por violencia, coerción y deprivación deliberadas con un énfasis particular en líderes y lideresas comunitarias, sociales y ambientalistas; comunidades expuestas a riesgos de protección como desplazamiento forzado, restricción de movilidad, confinamientos, amenazas, homicidios, violencia física y psicológica; individuos sobrevivientes o en riesgo de violencia, abuso, explotación, deprivación.

Los proyectos de Protección de NRC involucran el trabajo de dos equipos, por un lado, servicios especializados de protección y, por el otro lado, servicios de asistencia legal. 

Los proyectos de Protección contra violencia de NRC buscan reducir y mitigar el impacto de la violencia y el conflicto sobre individuos y comunidades expuestas al conflicto armado interno colombiano; inclusive riesgos de protección como amenazas, asesinatos, desplazamiento forzado, confinamiento, explotación, extorsión, robo, violencia basada en género, riesgos de minas y reclutamiento, uso y utilización por grupos armados. 

Las actividades de Protección contra violencia miran a prevenir la violencia antes de que ocurra, mientras se contribuye a la restauración de la seguridad para comunidades e individuos en riesgo. Se logra este resultado asegurando que los individuos sobrevivientes de violencia tengan recursos y capacidades de enfrentamiento mejoradas, aumentando la resiliencia y capacidad de mitigación frente a los riesgos de comunidades expuestas, fortaleciendo políticas públicas que protejan los individuos más vulnerables, y mejorando las capacidades de respuestas de instituciones y autoridades. 

Las actividades incluyen servicios individuales especializados de protección como gestión de casos y asistencia inmediata de protección, acompañamiento protectivo y apoyo psicosocial individual estructurado; acciones de autoprotección civil que incluyen mapeo de los riesgos dirigidos por las comunidades, aumento de capacidad en protección para miembros de comunidades, diseño y fortalecimiento de estrategias de autoprotección civil, asesoría y acompañamiento a las comunidades; actividades de fortalecimiento de entornos, incluyendo monitoreo y análisis de protección, protección por incidencia, y fortalecimiento de los mecanismos de coordinación de protección. Las actividades incluyen también intervención en contextos de emergencias como desplazamientos masivos, confinamientos, desastres naturales e incluyen evaluación rápida de necesidades de protección, asistencias de protección inmediata, entrenamientos en protección para líderes y lideresas, campañas de comunicación y talleres de manejo de estrés durante emergencias. 

En línea con la Estrategia de Protección de NRC, y dentro del contexto de respuesta a las dinámicas del conflicto armado en Colombia , el programa de protección se enfocará en personas afectadas por violencia, coerción y deprivación deliberadas con un énfasis particular en líderes y lideresas comunitarias, sociales y ambientalistas; comunidades expuestas a riesgos de protección como desplazamiento forzado, restricción de movilidad, confinamientos, amenazas, homicidios, violencia física y psicológica; individuos sobrevivientes o en riesgo de violencia, abuso, explotación, deprivación.

Los principales delitos denunciados son extorsión, hurto, robo, homicidios, lesiones, violencia sexual a NNA y mujeres adultas. A pesar de la mejora en ciertos indicadores de seguridad en el país, el alcance, control y violencia ejercida por grupos de delincuencia organizada continúa planteando serios desafíos a la protección de la población. Las pandillas poseen un amplio control en el país y están vinculadas a delitos violentos, extorsión, reclutamiento forzado y actividades relacionadas con el tráfico de drogas. Adicionalmente, las elecciones presidenciales y una transición política alterada, ha generado que los lideres indígenas se movilicen en protestas, generando varios bloqueos paralizando las principales rutas del país.  
Adicionalmente, las consecuencias del cambio climático en el área del corredor seco están provocando una crisis de inseguridad alimentaria, con cerca de 4.9 millones de personas afectadas, según el análisis del CIF (Clasificación Integrada en Fases) para el periodo junio/septiembre 2022; lo que representa un 25% del total de la población. Estas afectaciones incrementan situaciones de desigualdad, pobreza y de violencia, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG) y vulneración de los derechos de los niños, niñas y adolescentes, así como a grupos especialmente marginalizados como la población LGBTIQ+, indígena, en condición de discapacidad, generando desplazamiento al interior del país y hacia los países del norte del continente.

A pesar de la mejora en ciertos indicadores de seguridad en el país, el alcance, control y violencia ejercida por grupos de delincuencia organizada continúa planteando serios desafíos a la protección de la población.

Estas afectaciones incrementan situaciones de desigualdad, pobreza y de violencia, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG) y vulneración de los derechos de los niños, niñas y adolescentes, así como a grupos especialmente marginalizados como la población LGBTIQ+, indígena, en condición de discapacidad, generando desplazamiento al interior del país y hacia los países del norte del continente.

Los factores que subyacen a la movilidad humana en El Salvador son diversos y complejos e incluyen, entre otros: desigualdad social, brechas de acceso a servicios básicos, violencia en sus diversas formas y ámbitos, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG), limitado acceso a empleo formal y oportunidades económicas, y pretensiones de reunificación familiar. 
Los desastres naturales y de origen humano, exacerbados por el cambio climático, agravan los factores subyacentes a la movilidad. 
La violencia basada en género también motiva a las niñas, adolescentes y mujeres a huir y recurrir al desplazamiento interno y a la migración en condición irregular como medidas de afrontamiento, que ponen en riesgo su vida y seguridad en tránsito y destino. 
Más de 70,000 niños y niñas viven en el país sin uno o ambos padres como resultado de la migración.
La ubicación de El Salvador en la ruta migratoria en el norte de Centroamérica, su economía dolarizada y una percepción de seguridad son factores que inciden en el incremento de personas en movimientos mixtos que atraviesan el país. 
La violencia generalizada que sufren los niños, niñas y adolescentes en sus hogares, comunidades o escuelas, siguen siendo un detonante para el desplazamiento y la migración. La violencia tiene impactos diferenciados; si bien los homicidios disminuyeron en los últimos cinco años, seis de cada diez víctimas son niños y hombres jóvenes (entre 13 y 35 años), y la violencia sexual afecta desproporcionadamente a niñas y mujeres jóvenes.
La Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) declaró en julio de 2023 que se habían dado las condiciones para la aparición del fenómeno de El Niño.  También declaró que los efectos serían más notables a partir del segundo semestre de 2023, con una duración de 9 a 12 meses. Para la región centroamericana, la OMM informa que el fenómeno suele causar sequías severas.  
Se prevé que la sequía tenga graves repercusiones en los medios de subsistencia y la seguridad alimentaria de los hogares de las zonas más afectadas. Estos impactos pueden llevar a las personas a adoptar estrategias negativas para hacer frente a la situación, como el trabajo infantil, la discriminación en el reparto de alimentos dentro de la familia y el matrimonio precoz, entre otras. 
Con el presente proyecto, UNICEF tiene como objetivo brindar una respuesta humanitaria para que niñas, niños y adolescentes en contexto de movilidad o afectados por sequía, que están expuestos a violencia, abuso o explotación, incluyendo a población LGBTIQ+ o con discapacidad, accedan a servicios especializados e integrales de protección de la infancia. Ello orientado al fortalecimiento de su resiliencia, la reintegración en sus comunidades y la plena restitución de sus derechos. 
Las niñas, niños y adolescentes con necesidades de protección beneficiarios recibirán protección a través de albergues o acceso a espacios seguros, apoyo psicosocial y atención a la salud mental, asistencia legal y respuesta a otras necesidades humanitarias (asistencia humanitaria); junto con el desarrollo de habilidades para la vida para ellas y ellos, así como para las madres, padres o personas cuidadoras, fortaleciendo los lazos familiares. Para ello, se apoyarán servicios especializados de protección adecuados a la edad, género y diversidad, líneas de ayuda  mecanismos de denuncia, espacios amigables de apoyo psicosocial, mecanismos de referencia y gestión de casos, promoviendo entornos protectores a nivel familiar y comunitario.

Los desastres naturales y de origen humano, exacerbados por el cambio climático, agravan los factores subyacentes a la movilidad. 
La violencia basada en género también motiva a las niñas, adolescentes y mujeres a huir y recurrir al desplazamiento interno y a la migración en condición irregular como medidas de afrontamiento, que ponen en riesgo su vida y seguridad en tránsito y destino. 
Más de 70,000 niños y niñas viven en el país sin uno o ambos padres como resultado de la migración.
La ubicación de El Salvador en la ruta migratoria en el norte de Centroamérica, su economía dolarizada y una percepción de seguridad son factores que inciden en el incremento de personas en movimientos mixtos que atraviesan el país. 
La violencia generalizada que sufren los niños, niñas y adolescentes en sus hogares, comunidades o escuelas, siguen siendo un detonante para el desplazamiento y la migración. La violencia tiene impactos diferenciados; si bien los homicidios disminuyeron en los últimos cinco años, seis de cada diez víctimas son niños y hombres jóvenes (entre 13 y 35 años), y la violencia sexual afecta desproporcionadamente a niñas y mujeres jóvenes.
La Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) declaró en julio de 2023 que se habían dado las condiciones para la aparición del fenómeno de El Niño.  También declaró que los efectos serían más notables a partir del segundo semestre de 2023, con una duración de 9 a 12 meses. Para la región centroamericana, la OMM informa que el fenómeno suele causar sequías severas.  
Se prevé que la sequía tenga graves repercusiones en los medios de subsistencia y la seguridad alimentaria de los hogares de las zonas más afectadas. Estos impactos pueden llevar a las personas a adoptar estrategias negativas para hacer frente a la situación, como el trabajo infantil, la discriminación en el reparto de alimentos dentro de la familia y el matrimonio precoz, entre otras. 
Con el presente proyecto, UNICEF tiene como objetivo brindar una respuesta humanitaria para que niñas, niños y adolescentes en contexto de movilidad o afectados por sequía, que están expuestos a violencia, abuso o explotación, incluyendo a población LGBTIQ+ o con discapacidad, accedan a servicios especializados e integrales de protección de la infancia. Ello orientado al fortalecimiento de su resiliencia, la reintegración en sus comunidades y la plena restitución de sus derechos. 
Las niñas, niños y adolescentes con necesidades de protección beneficiarios recibirán protección a través de albergues o acceso a espacios seguros, apoyo psicosocial y atención a la salud mental, asistencia legal y respuesta a otras necesidades humanitarias (asistencia humanitaria); junto con el desarrollo de habilidades para la vida para ellas y ellos, así como para las madres, padres o personas cuidadoras, fortaleciendo los lazos familiares. Para ello, se apoyarán servicios especializados de protección adecuados a la edad, género y diversidad, líneas de ayuda  mecanismos de denuncia, espacios amigables de apoyo psicosocial, mecanismos de referencia y gestión de casos, promoviendo entornos protectores a nivel familiar y comunitario.

UNICEF will contribute to the inter-agency humanitarian response in 2024 and will also complement UNICEF's development work under its 2023-2026 country programme.

Objective: UNICEF is committed to continuing to focus on critical unmet needs and remaining inequalities related to maternal, neonatal and under-five child survival.

Project Description: The project focuses on improving access and quality of basic services to address the multiple health deprivations faced by children, adolescents and pregnant women. UNICEF's response incorporates a child-centred approach and is built around community settings, including health centers and surrounding communities. Priority will be given to supporting health systems that reliably provide integrated service packages for children, adolescents and women, focusing on health, nutrition and WASH, also facilitating child protection services and linked to social protection and social well-being initiatives, as well as as well as the educational sector. , particularly for health promotion and prevention, improving health literacy, screening and promoting early childhood development and the mental health and well-being of children and their caregivers.

Strategies and implementation: UNICEF will promote three approaches to achieve the goals:
1. Address inequalities in health outcomes;
2. Strengthen health systems, including emergency preparedness, response and resilience; and
3. Promotion of integrated and multisectoral policies and programs.

The strategy also includes:
Strengthen service delivery, empower communities for health promotion, prevention and social behavior change, build capacity of health service providers, strengthen supply chain systems (essential products and equipment ), generate demand and strengthen accountability.

Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness of the project, UNICEF will implement a robust monitoring and evaluation system. This will involve periodic monitoring of health interventions, evaluations of health professionals after training and monitoring of the distribution and use of supplies, as well as evaluation of the quality of case management based on compliance with standardized protocols and regulations.

These actions will be implemented in selected urban, peri-urban and remote rural areas of 10 nationally prioritized states, with the exception of HIV interventions and immunization coverage is national, and will reach 750,303 people, including 559,291 children and 125,000 pregnant women .",,,"HAC-VENEZUELA

Los impactos de COVID-19 han intensificado esta situación, dejando a miles de NNAs con necesidades de educación, inmunización, medicamentos, nutrición, agua potable y protección. La mala calidad y cantidad del agua, combinadas con intermitencia, son preocupaciones clave en Venezuela, lo que hace que el lavado de manos, una medida clave de prevención de infecciones, sea extremadamente desafiante.
Entre agosto y septiembre de 2021, el OSPV informó que 65,6% de la población consideraba que el servicio de agua era inadecuado, y solo 27,2% de la población en ciudades tenía suministro regular de agua. Antes de la pandemia, 61% de escuelas carecían de acceso diario a agua potable segura y la ausencia de servicios WASH en ellas fue la causa del ausentismo escolar en 28% de los casos (HNO OCHA, 2019). Con las medidas de contención de la COVID-19, las escuelas estuvieron parcialmente cerradas durante más de 18 meses. La falta de limpieza, desinfección y mantenimiento de los servicios durante el cierre prolongado de las escuelas ha resultado en un mayor deterioro de los servicios de WASH, lo que dificulta la preparación de las escuelas para garantizar un regreso seguro. Las encuestas de UNICEF en 2023 a 450 escuelas públicas en quince estados muestran que todas las escuelas encuestadas tenían acceso limitado a los servicios WASH. Faltan puntos de lavado de manos adecuados incluso en los establecimientos de salud, donde más se necesitan: el 58% de los 130 establecimientos de salud evaluados en 11 estados no cuentan con instalaciones para el lavado de manos en los puntos de atención donde se trata a los pacientes. Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%. Esto pone a estudiantes, maestros, médicos, enfermeras, pacientes y a toda la población: en riesgo.
Para implementar WASH en instituciones, y comunidades adyacentes, en función del nivel de intervención se incluirán los siguientes elementos para la mejora de los servicios WASH, según la pertinencia y contexto:
•	Diagnóstico participativo de comunidades e instituciones, incluyendo elementos de género, AAP, discapacidad y participación adolescente;
•	Asegurar prácticas de higiene, de limpieza y de tratamiento y conservación del agua a través de actividades con enfoques comunitarios, que incluya la distribución de suministros básicos WASH, de acuerdo con las necesidades específicas de cada institución; así como su adecuado monitoreo y seguimiento;
•	Reparación, rehabilitación y acondicionamiento de instalaciones WASH prioritarias, bajo estándares de calidad, resiliencia, seguridad y sostenibilidad;
•	Formación de comités multidisciplinarios de gestión (instituciones y/o comunitarios), constituidos por personal técnico, administrativo, alumnos/pacientes y lideres comunitarios, para fortalecer capacidades y apoyar la implementación y monitoreo de actividades, bajo estándares de calidad (WASHFIT, WASHSIT, Directrices PCI, 3 estrellas, etc).
•	Distruibuicion de Incentivos, adecuación/dignificación de espacios a personal de mantenimiento y de limpieza, para reforzarla sostenibilidad de las intervenciones;

Adicionalmente, FAO, WFP y UNICEF están comprometidos a implementar programa integral, en escuelas de educación inicial y especial, y las comunidades y los servicios de salud a su alrededor para crear comunidades resilientes, utilizando escuelas como punto central de la comunidad, donde cada organizacion contribuirá en su área de expertise.

La falta de limpieza, desinfección y mantenimiento de los servicios durante el cierre prolongado de las escuelas ha resultado en un mayor deterioro de los servicios de WASH, lo que dificulta la preparación de las escuelas para garantizar un regreso seguro. Las encuestas de UNICEF en 2023 a 450 escuelas públicas en quince estados muestran que todas las escuelas encuestadas tenían acceso limitado a los servicios WASH. Faltan puntos de lavado de manos adecuados incluso en los establecimientos de salud, donde más se necesitan: el 58% de los 130 establecimientos de salud evaluados en 11 estados no cuentan con instalaciones para el lavado de manos en los puntos de atención donde se trata a los pacientes. Con acceso limitado al agua y/o sin instalaciones para la higiene de manos, el cumplimiento de las mejores prácticas de higiene de manos por parte de los trabajadores de la salud puede ser tan bajo como el 8%. Esto pone a estudiantes, maestros, médicos, enfermeras, pacientes y a toda la población: en riesgo.
Para implementar WASH en instituciones, y comunidades adyacentes, en función del nivel de intervención se incluirán los siguientes elementos para la mejora de los servicios WASH, según la pertinencia y contexto:
•	Diagnóstico participativo de comunidades e instituciones, incluyendo elementos de género, AAP, discapacidad y participación adolescente;
•	Asegurar prácticas de higiene, de limpieza y de tratamiento y conservación del agua a través de actividades con enfoques comunitarios, que incluya la distribución de suministros básicos WASH, de acuerdo con las necesidades específicas de cada institución; así como su adecuado monitoreo y seguimiento;
•	Reparación, rehabilitación y acondicionamiento de instalaciones WASH prioritarias, bajo estándares de calidad, resiliencia, seguridad y sostenibilidad;
•	Formación de comités multidisciplinarios de gestión (instituciones y/o comunitarios), constituidos por personal técnico, administrativo, alumnos/pacientes y lideres comunitarios, para fortalecer capacidades y apoyar la implementación y monitoreo de actividades, bajo estándares de calidad (WASHFIT, WASHSIT, Directrices PCI, 3 estrellas, etc).
•	Distruibuicion de Incentivos, adecuación/dignificación de espacios a personal de mantenimiento y de limpieza, para reforzarla sostenibilidad de las intervenciones;

Adicionalmente, FAO, WFP y UNICEF están comprometidos a implementar programa integral, en escuelas de educación inicial y especial, y las comunidades y los servicios de salud a su alrededor para crear comunidades resilientes, utilizando escuelas como punto central de la comunidad, donde cada organizacion contribuirá en su área de expertise.

Los proyectos de Protección de NRC involucran el trabajo de dos equipos, por un lado, servicios especializados de protección y, por el otro lado, servicios de asistencia legal. 

Los proyectos de Protección contra violencia de NRC buscan reducir y mitigar el impacto de la violencia y el conflicto sobre individuos y comunidades expuestas al conflicto armado interno colombiano; inclusive riesgos de protección como amenazas, asesinatos, desplazamiento forzado, confinamiento, explotación, extorsión, robo, violencia basada en género, riesgos de minas y reclutamiento, uso y utilización por grupos armados. 

Las actividades de Protección contra violencia miran a prevenir la violencia antes de que ocurra, mientras se contribuye a la restauración de la seguridad para comunidades e individuos en riesgo. Se logra este resultado asegurando que los individuos sobrevivientes de violencia tengan recursos y capacidades de enfrentamiento mejoradas, aumentando la resiliencia y capacidad de mitigación frente a los riesgos de comunidades expuestas, fortaleciendo políticas públicas que protejan los individuos más vulnerables, y mejorando las capacidades de respuestas de instituciones y autoridades. 

Las actividades incluyen servicios individuales especializados de protección como gestión de casos y asistencia inmediata de protección, acompañamiento protectivo y apoyo psicosocial individual estructurado; acciones de autoprotección civil que incluyen mapeo de los riesgos dirigidos por las comunidades, aumento de capacidad en protección para miembros de comunidades, diseño y fortalecimiento de estrategias de autoprotección civil, asesoría y acompañamiento a las comunidades; actividades de fortalecimiento de entornos, incluyendo monitoreo y análisis de protección, protección por incidencia, y fortalecimiento de los mecanismos de coordinación de protección. Las actividades incluyen también intervención en contextos de emergencias como desplazamientos masivos, confinamientos, desastres naturales e incluyen evaluación rápida de necesidades de protección, asistencias de protección inmediata, entrenamientos en protección para líderes y lideresas, campañas de comunicación y talleres de manejo de estrés durante emergencias. 

En línea con la Estrategia de Protección de NRC, y dentro del contexto de respuesta a las dinámicas del conflicto armado en Colombia , el programa de protección se enfocará en personas afectadas por violencia, coerción y deprivación deliberadas con un énfasis particular en líderes y lideresas comunitarias, sociales y ambientalistas; comunidades expuestas a riesgos de protección como desplazamiento forzado, restricción de movilidad, confinamientos, amenazas, homicidios, violencia física y psicológica; individuos sobrevivientes o en riesgo de violencia, abuso, explotación, deprivación. 

Las intervenciones de protección contra violencia se priorizarán para los grupos más vulnerables como líderes/as sociales y defensores de derechos humanos, miembros de comunidades rurales, comunidades afrocolombianas e indígenas, mujeres y comunidad LGBTQI+.

Por un lado, la situación de violencia e inseguridad sigue impactando a miles de personas, evidenciado en el indicador de muertes violentas el cual registró un incremento de 6,7 por ciento con respecto al año anterior, llegando a una tasa de 17.3 por cada 100 mil habitantes, una de las más altas en Centro América. Los principales delitos denunciados son extorsión, hurto, robo, homicidios, lesiones, violencia sexual a NNA y mujeres adultas. A pesar de la mejora en ciertos indicadores de seguridad en el país, el alcance, control y violencia ejercida por grupos de delincuencia organizada continúa planteando serios desafíos a la protección de la población.

Estas afectaciones incrementan situaciones de desigualdad, pobreza y de violencia, incluida la violencia basada en género (VBG) y vulneración de los derechos de los niños, niñas y adolescentes, así como a grupos especialmente marginalizados como la población LGBTIQ+, indígena, en condición de discapacidad, generando desplazamiento al interior del país y hacia los países del norte del continente.

Objective: UNICEF is committed to continuing to focus on critical unmet needs and remaining inequalities related to maternal, neonatal and under-five child survival.

Project Description: The project focuses on improving access and quality of basic services to address the multiple health deprivations faced by children, adolescents and pregnant women. UNICEF's response incorporates a child-centred approach and is built around community settings, including health centers and surrounding communities. Priority will be given to supporting health systems that reliably provide integrated service packages for children, adolescents and women, focusing on health, nutrition and WASH, also facilitating child protection services and linked to social protection and social well-being initiatives, as well as as well as the educational sector. , particularly for health promotion and prevention, improving health literacy, screening and promoting early childhood development and the mental health and well-being of children and their caregivers.

Strategies and implementation: UNICEF will promote three approaches to achieve the goals:
1. Address inequalities in health outcomes;
2. Strengthen health systems, including emergency preparedness, response and resilience; and
3. Promotion of integrated and multisectoral policies and programs.

The strategy also includes:
Strengthen service delivery, empower communities for health promotion, prevention and social behavior change, build capacity of health service providers, strengthen supply chain systems (essential products and equipment ), generate demand and strengthen accountability.

Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness of the project, UNICEF will implement a robust monitoring and evaluation system. This will involve periodic monitoring of health interventions, evaluations of health professionals after training and monitoring of the distribution and use of supplies, as well as evaluation of the quality of case management based on compliance with standardized protocols and regulations.

These actions will be implemented in selected urban, peri-urban and remote rural areas of 10 nationally prioritized states, with the exception of HIV interventions and immunization coverage is national, and will reach 750,303 people, including 559,291 children and 125,000 pregnant women .",,,"HAC-VENEZUELA	Japan	Venezuela	SM240465	Venezuela: Development of Cold Chain for the Expanded Programme on Immunization	Health Apoyo a niñas, niños, adolescentes y mujeres, especialmente a aquellos en condiciones de mayor vulnerabilidad, para incrementar su acceso a servicios de salud de calidad, más pertinentes, oportunos, incluyentes y eficaces, incluso en contextos de emergencia en 54 municipios.
